Chunk #0:
04_10_2016	82	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.
04_10_2016	83	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.
04_10_2016	84	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...

04_10_2016	148	KAINE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Absolutely, without firing a shot.
04_10_2016	149	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.

Chunk #3:
04_10_2016	162	PENCE	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and overrun vast areas of Iraq.
04_10_2016	163	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.
04_10_2016	164	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.
04_10_2016	165	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	And guess what?
04_10_2016	166	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.
04_10_2016	167	PENCE	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	It was a failure of the secretary of state...

Chunk #4:
04_10_2016	180	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.
04_10_2016	181	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.

Chunk #5:
04_10_2016	185	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.
04_10_2016	186	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.

Chunk #6:
04_10_2016	189	PENCE	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.
04_10_2016	190	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.
04_10_2016	191	PENCE	3	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	They want to expand it into a single-payer program.
04_10_2016	192	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.
04_10_2016	193	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.

Chunk #7:
04_10_2016	211	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Trump plan is a different plan.
04_10_2016	212	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a "you're fired" plan.
04_10_2016	213	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there's two key elements to it.
04_10_2016	214	KAINE	4	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.
04_10_2016	215	KAINE	3	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.
04_10_2016	216	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.
04_10_2016	217	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.
04_10_2016	218	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.
04_10_2016	219	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.
04_10_2016	220	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.
04_10_2016	221	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.

Chunk #8:
04_10_2016	233	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.
04_10_2016	234	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're in the...
04_10_2016	235	KAINE	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	Fifteen million new jobs?
04_10_2016	236	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.

Chunk #9:

04_10_2016	241	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the poverty level and the median income...
04_10_2016	242	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	... stepped into the Oval Office.
04_10_2016	243	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.

04_10_2016	293	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And he's breaking his promise.

04_10_2016	307	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Gentlemen...
04_10_2016	308	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	If you can't meet Nixon's standard...

Chunk #13:
04_10_2016	324	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.

04_10_2016	326	KAINE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.
04_10_2016	327	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it.

04_10_2016	393	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.

Chunk #16:
04_10_2016	412	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.
04_10_2016	413	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They see his commitment to law and order.
04_10_2016	414	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.

Chunk #21:
04_10_2016	514	PENCE	5	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.
04_10_2016	515	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.

Chunk #40:
04_10_2016	1179	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.

19_10_2016	45	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.

Chunk #45:
19_10_2016	89	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it was a well-crafted decision.
19_10_2016	90	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.

Chunk #47:
19_10_2016	124	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.
19_10_2016	125	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.

Chunk #48:
19_10_2016	138	WALLACE	3	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.
19_10_2016	139	WALLACE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.

19_10_2016	200	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.

Chunk #51:

19_10_2016	209	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.

Chunk #52:
19_10_2016	229	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.
19_10_2016	230	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.

Chunk #53:
19_10_2016	238	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.

19_10_2016	254	TRUMP	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
19_10_2016	255	TRUMP	3	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.
19_10_2016	256	TRUMP	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.
19_10_2016	257	TRUMP	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.

Chunk #55:
19_10_2016	267	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.

Chunk #56:
19_10_2016	270	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.
19_10_2016	271	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And Donald knows a lot about this.
19_10_2016	272	CLINTON	5	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.
19_10_2016	273	CLINTON	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported."
19_10_2016	274	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.

19_10_2016	407	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.

19_10_2016	420	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.
19_10_2016	421	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's...
19_10_2016	422	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	Wrong.
19_10_2016	423	CLINTON	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
19_10_2016	424	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.

Chunk #65:
19_10_2016	481	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.

26_09_2016	672	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.

Chunk #124:
26_09_2016	674	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.
26_09_2016	675	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	These are felons.

Chunk #125:
26_09_2016	704	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.
26_09_2016	705	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Property crime is down 40 percent.

Chunk #126:
26_09_2016	759	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And it was terminated by current mayor.
26_09_2016	760	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.
26_09_2016	761	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Tremendous beyond belief.
26_09_2016	762	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.
26_09_2016	763	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	It had a very, very big impact.
26_09_2016	764	CLINTON	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.

Chunk #127:
26_09_2016	813	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.

26_09_2016	816	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.
26_09_2016	817	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.

Chunk #128:
26_09_2016	886	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.
26_09_2016	887	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.

Chunk #129:

26_09_2016	917	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.
26_09_2016	918	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.

Chunk #132:
26_09_2016	993	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.
26_09_2016	994	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	And ISIS was formed.

Chunk #133:
26_09_2016	1000	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.
26_09_2016	1001	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.

Chunk #134:
26_09_2016	1004	CLINTON	3	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.
26_09_2016	1005	TRUMP	5	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	Wrong.

Chunk #135:
26_09_2016	1009	CLINTON	4	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.
26_09_2016	1010	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.
26_09_2016	1011	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.

Chunk #136:
26_09_2016	1044	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.
26_09_2016	1045	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But two things.
26_09_2016	1046	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.
26_09_2016	1047	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.

Chunk #137:
26_09_2016	1051	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.
26_09_2016	1052	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that's great.
26_09_2016	1053	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.

Chunk #138:
26_09_2016	1058	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
26_09_2016	1059	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.

Chunk #139:
26_09_2016	1090	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The record shows that I'm right.

26_09_2016	1125	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have a winning temperament.

Chunk #141:

26_09_2016	1162	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wrong.

Chunk #142:
26_09_2016	1180	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.
26_09_2016	1181	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They do not pay us.
26_09_2016	1182	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.

Chunk #143:
26_09_2016	1200	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.
26_09_2016	1201	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.

Chunk #144:

26_09_2016	1212	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	China should go into North Korea.
26_09_2016	1213	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.

Chunk #145:
26_09_2016	1301	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia
26_09_2016	1302	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?
26_09_2016	1303	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	All you have to do is speak to them.

Chunk #146:
26_09_2016	1325	CLINTON	3	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...
26_09_2016	1326	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I never said that.

Chunk #147:

26_09_2016	1332	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."

26_09_2016	1382	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.
26_09_2016	1383	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Ended up becoming citizens.
26_09_2016	1384	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And it was 800.
