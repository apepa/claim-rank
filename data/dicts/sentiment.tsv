26	FIRST	There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.	-0.327241	negative
27	FIRST	However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.	-0.742532	negative
28	FIRST	Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?	0	neutral
29	FIRST	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	0.935088	positive

31	FIRST	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	0.513235	positive

34	FIRST	I want us to invest in you.	0	neutral
35	FIRST	I want us to invest in your future.	0	neutral
36	FIRST	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0.87077	positive
37	FIRST	We also have to make the economy fairer.	0	neutral
38	FIRST	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0	neutral
39	FIRST	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	0	neutral
40	FIRST	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	0	neutral

59	FIRST	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	0.644852	positive
60	FIRST	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	-0.766956	negative
61	FIRST	And we have a very good fight.	0	neutral
62	FIRST	And we have a winning fight.	0	neutral
63	FIRST	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	0	neutral
64	FIRST	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	-0.777364	negative
65	FIRST	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	0	neutral
66	FIRST	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	0.661445	positive
67	FIRST	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	-0.532289	negative

69	FIRST	You see that, their small car division leaving.	0	neutral
70	FIRST	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	-0.381019	negative
71	FIRST	They're all leaving.	-0.52122	negative
72	FIRST	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	-0.715676	negative
73	FIRST	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	0	neutral
74	FIRST	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0	neutral
75	FIRST	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	-0.774447	negative
76	FIRST	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	-0.436685	negative
77	FIRST	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	0	neutral
78	FIRST	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	0	neutral
79	FIRST	They're going to Mexico.	0	neutral
80	FIRST	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	0	neutral
81	FIRST	We cannot let it happen.	-0.349396	negative
82	FIRST	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	-0.570716	negative
83	FIRST	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	0	neutral
84	FIRST	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	0.743174	positive
85	FIRST	Companies will come.	0	neutral
86	FIRST	They will build.	0	neutral
87	FIRST	They will expand.	0	neutral

90	FIRST	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	-0.666535	negative
91	FIRST	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?	0	neutral
92	FIRST	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	0.684261	positive
93	FIRST	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	0	neutral
94	FIRST	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	0.728983	positive
95	FIRST	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	0	neutral
96	FIRST	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	-0.507579	negative
97	FIRST	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	-0.642631	negative
98	FIRST	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	-0.640258	negative
99	FIRST	That is not how we grow the economy.	-0.532665	negative
100	FIRST	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	0.654914	positive
101	FIRST	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0	neutral
102	FIRST	I understand that.	0	neutral
103	FIRST	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	0.849051	positive
104	FIRST	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	0.653201	positive
105	FIRST	I don't buy that.	-0.598218	negative
106	FIRST	I have a different experience.	0.434672	positive
107	FIRST	My father was a small-businessman.	0	neutral
108	FIRST	He worked really hard.	0	neutral
109	FIRST	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	-0.50324	negative
110	FIRST	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	0.959886	positive
111	FIRST	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	0	neutral
112	FIRST	Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.	0	neutral
113	FIRST	You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.	-0.343319	negative
114	FIRST	How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?	0	neutral
115	FIRST	How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?	0	neutral
116	FIRST	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0.442409	positive
117	FIRST	Our country's in deep trouble.	-0.71224	negative
118	FIRST	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	-0.332306	negative
119	FIRST	They're the best, the best ever at it.	0.895087	positive
120	FIRST	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	-0.868641	negative
121	FIRST	So we have to do that.	0	neutral
122	FIRST	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	-0.328879	negative
123	FIRST	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	0	neutral
124	FIRST	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	0	neutral
125	FIRST	They have a VAT tax.	-0.409977	negative
126	FIRST	We're on a different system.	0	neutral
127	FIRST	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	0	neutral
128	FIRST	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	-0.299116	negative
129	FIRST	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	-0.515617	negative
130	FIRST	It's a defective agreement.	-0.740837	negative
131	FIRST	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	-0.554925	negative
132	FIRST	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	0	neutral
133	FIRST	Good.	0.481019	positive
134	FIRST	I want you to be very happy.	0.751314	positive
135	FIRST	It's very important to me.	0.647957	positive
136	FIRST	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	0	neutral
137	FIRST	She's been doing this for 30 years.	0	neutral
138	FIRST	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	-0.552063	negative
139	FIRST	The NAFTA agreement is defective.	-0.700682	negative
140	FIRST	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	-0.317225	negative
141	FIRST	Let me interrupt just a moment, but...	-0.394709	negative
142	FIRST	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	-0.368998	negative
143	FIRST	They should have been doing this for years.	0	neutral
144	FIRST	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	-0.454484	negative
145	FIRST	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	-0.319601	negative
146	FIRST	Back to the question, though.	0	neutral
147	FIRST	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	0	neutral
148	FIRST	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	0	neutral
149	FIRST	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	0	neutral
150	FIRST	The companies are leaving.	-0.46293	negative
151	FIRST	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	-0.395429	negative
152	FIRST	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	-0.716552	negative
153	FIRST	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	0.811576	positive
154	FIRST	We wish you a lot of luck.	0.564501	positive
155	FIRST	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	0	neutral
156	FIRST	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	-0.38166	negative
157	FIRST	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	-0.594248	negative
158	FIRST	We have to stop them from leaving.	-0.52427	negative
159	FIRST	And that's a big, big factor.	0	neutral
160	FIRST	Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.	0	neutral
161	FIRST	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0	neutral
162	FIRST	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	-0.884646	negative
163	FIRST	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	0	neutral
164	FIRST	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	0	neutral
165	FIRST	"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""	0	neutral
166	FIRST	Well, it did collapse.	0	neutral
167	FIRST	That's called business, by the way.	0	neutral
168	FIRST	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	-0.672846	negative
169	FIRST	Five million people lost their homes.	-0.572574	negative
170	FIRST	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	-0.422521	negative
171	FIRST	Now, we have come back from that abyss.	0	neutral
172	FIRST	And it has not been easy.	0	neutral
173	FIRST	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	-0.748295	negative
174	FIRST	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	-0.869197	negative
175	FIRST	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	0	neutral
176	FIRST	Take clean energy.	0	neutral
177	FIRST	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	0	neutral
178	FIRST	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	-0.764381	negative
179	FIRST	I think it's real.	0	neutral
180	FIRST	I did not.	-0.412782	negative
181	FIRST	I did not.	-0.412782	negative
182	FIRST	I do not say that.	-0.364975	negative
183	FIRST	I think science is real.	0	neutral
184	FIRST	I do not say that.	-0.364975	negative
185	FIRST	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	0.798738	positive
186	FIRST	And here's what we can do.	0	neutral
187	FIRST	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	0	neutral
188	FIRST	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	0.742256	positive
189	FIRST	We can build a new modern electric grid.	0.821066	positive
190	FIRST	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0	neutral
191	FIRST	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	-0.564232	negative
192	FIRST	Mr. Trump?	0	neutral
193	FIRST	She talks about solar panels.	0	neutral
194	FIRST	We invested in a solar company, our country.	0.56729	positive
195	FIRST	That was a disaster.	-0.59137	negative
196	FIRST	They lost plenty of money on that one.	-0.618294	negative
197	FIRST	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	0	neutral
198	FIRST	Our energy policies are a disaster.	-0.674848	negative
199	FIRST	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	-0.700085	negative
200	FIRST	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	-0.678939	negative
201	FIRST	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	0	neutral
202	FIRST	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	0	neutral
203	FIRST	So I will tell you this.	0	neutral
204	FIRST	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0.78178	positive
205	FIRST	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	0.497306	positive
206	FIRST	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	-0.598273	negative
207	FIRST	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	0	neutral
208	FIRST	You've been doing this for 30 years.	0	neutral
209	FIRST	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	0.565314	positive
210	FIRST	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	0.849425	positive
211	FIRST	Well, actually...	0.596691	positive
212	FIRST	I will bring -- excuse me.	0	neutral
213	FIRST	I will bring back jobs.	0	neutral
214	FIRST	You can't bring back jobs.	-0.532421	negative
215	FIRST	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	0.47709	positive
216	FIRST	Yeah, for 30 years.	0	neutral
217	FIRST	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0	neutral
218	FIRST	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	0.762655	positive
219	FIRST	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	0	neutral
220	FIRST	Well, he approved NAFTA...	0	neutral
221	FIRST	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
222	FIRST	... million new jobs, a balanced budget...	0	neutral
223	FIRST	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	-0.331999	negative
224	FIRST	Incomes went up for everybody.	0	neutral
225	FIRST	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	0.505814	positive
226	FIRST	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	0	neutral
227	FIRST	Will they create jobs in America?	0	neutral
228	FIRST	Will they raise incomes in America?	0	neutral
229	FIRST	And are they good for our national security?	0	neutral
230	FIRST	Some of them I voted for.	0	neutral
231	FIRST	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	-0.462068	negative
232	FIRST	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	0	neutral
233	FIRST	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	-0.4904	negative
234	FIRST	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	0.480004	positive
235	FIRST	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	0	neutral
236	FIRST	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0	neutral
237	FIRST	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	0	neutral
238	FIRST	We increased them to China 50 percent.	0	neutral
239	FIRST	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	-0.549721	negative
240	FIRST	Very quickly...	0	neutral
241	FIRST	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	-0.383577	negative

281	FIRST	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	-0.844437	negative

294	FIRST	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0.772259	positive
295	FIRST	So we have a very robust set of plans.	0.856429	positive
296	FIRST	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	-0.798747	negative

301	FIRST	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	-0.318269	negative
302	FIRST	I'm very proud of it.	0.845395	positive
303	FIRST	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	0	neutral

305	FIRST	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	0	neutral
306	FIRST	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	-0.547132	negative
307	FIRST	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	0	neutral

322	FIRST	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	0	neutral
323	FIRST	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	0	neutral

351	FIRST	And I want to talk about taxes.	-0.55532	negative
352	FIRST	The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.	0	neutral
353	FIRST	Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.	0	neutral
354	FIRST	I'd like you to further defend that.	0	neutral
355	FIRST	And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.	0	neutral
356	FIRST	I'd like you to defend that.	0	neutral
357	FIRST	And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.	0	neutral

359	FIRST	They're going to expand their companies.	0	neutral

361	FIRST	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	-0.561478	negative
362	FIRST	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	0	neutral
363	FIRST	It's a great thing for the middle class.	0.75023	positive
364	FIRST	It's a great thing for companies to expand.	0.774085	positive
365	FIRST	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	-0.9326	negative
366	FIRST	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	-0.626784	negative
367	FIRST	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	-0.504576	negative
368	FIRST	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	-0.898007	negative
369	FIRST	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	0	neutral
370	FIRST	And here's the thing.	0	neutral
371	FIRST	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	-0.439399	negative
372	FIRST	I happen to think it's double that.	-0.47336	negative
373	FIRST	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	-0.618162	negative
374	FIRST	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	0	neutral
375	FIRST	But we have no leadership.	0	neutral
376	FIRST	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0	neutral
377	FIRST	All right.	0.526333	positive
378	FIRST	You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.	-0.444766	negative
379	FIRST	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	-0.757695	negative

388	FIRST	Yes.	0	neutral
389	FIRST	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	0.591748	positive
390	FIRST	We've looked at your tax proposals.	0	neutral
391	FIRST	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	-0.803263	negative
392	FIRST	I happen to support that.	0	neutral
393	FIRST	Then you didn't read it.	0	neutral
394	FIRST	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	0.435965	positive
395	FIRST	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	0.708337	positive
396	FIRST	You've proposed an approach that has a...	0	neutral
397	FIRST	Who gave it that name?	0	neutral
398	FIRST	The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0	neutral
399	FIRST	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
400	FIRST	Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.	-0.317343	negative
401	FIRST	... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.	0.668397	positive
402	FIRST	And when you look at what you are proposing...	0	neutral
403	FIRST	How much?	0	neutral
404	FIRST	How much for my family?	0	neutral
405	FIRST	... it is...	0	neutral
406	FIRST	Lester, how much?	0	neutral

408	FIRST	Trickle-down did not work.	-0.588702	negative
409	FIRST	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	-0.740779	negative
410	FIRST	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	0	neutral
411	FIRST	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	0.880389	positive
412	FIRST	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	0	neutral
413	FIRST	I don't think top-down works in America.	0	neutral
414	FIRST	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	0	neutral
415	FIRST	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	0.779468	positive
416	FIRST	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	0.541603	positive
417	FIRST	Mr. Trump, we're...	0	neutral
418	FIRST	Typical politician.	0	neutral

422	FIRST	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	-0.779226	negative
423	FIRST	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	-0.650181	negative
424	FIRST	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	0.561512	positive
425	FIRST	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	-0.787937	negative
426	FIRST	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	-0.708223	negative
427	FIRST	And we better be awfully careful.	0.578318	positive
428	FIRST	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	-0.376832	negative
429	FIRST	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	0	neutral
430	FIRST	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	-0.406248	negative
431	FIRST	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	-0.821628	negative
432	FIRST	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	-0.303457	negative
433	FIRST	Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.	-0.348174	negative
434	FIRST	And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.	0	neutral
435	FIRST	Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?	-0.734481	negative
436	FIRST	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	-0.469768	negative
437	FIRST	And it'll be released.	0	neutral
438	FIRST	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	0	neutral
439	FIRST	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	-0.31857	negative
440	FIRST	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	0	neutral
441	FIRST	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	0	neutral
442	FIRST	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0.512548	positive
443	FIRST	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	-0.573574	negative
444	FIRST	You know what that is?	0	neutral
445	FIRST	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0	neutral
446	FIRST	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	-0.437694	negative
447	FIRST	The IRS says an audit...	0	neutral

451	FIRST	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	0.449511	positive
452	FIRST	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	0	neutral

472	FIRST	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	0	neutral
473	FIRST	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	-0.487103	negative
474	FIRST	So it's negotiable?	0	neutral
475	FIRST	It's not negotiable, no.	-0.388532	negative
476	FIRST	Let her release the e-mails.	0	neutral
477	FIRST	Why did she delete 33,000...	-0.718025	negative
478	FIRST	Well, I'll let her answer that.	0.491973	positive
479	FIRST	But let me just admonish the audience one more time.	-0.54549	negative
480	FIRST	There was an agreement.	0	neutral
481	FIRST	We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.	0.672397	positive
482	FIRST	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
483	FIRST	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	0.5369	positive
484	FIRST	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	0	neutral
485	FIRST	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	0.464459	positive
486	FIRST	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	0	neutral
487	FIRST	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	-0.354085	negative
488	FIRST	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	0	neutral
489	FIRST	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	0	neutral
490	FIRST	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0	neutral
491	FIRST	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	0	neutral
492	FIRST	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	-0.374682	negative
493	FIRST	That makes me smart.	0.833922	positive
494	FIRST	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	-0.545042	negative
495	FIRST	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	-0.495855	negative
496	FIRST	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	-0.338806	negative
497	FIRST	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	-0.34261	negative
498	FIRST	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	0	neutral
499	FIRST	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	-0.43087	negative
500	FIRST	And we'll guess.	0	neutral
501	FIRST	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	0	neutral
502	FIRST	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	-0.533624	negative
503	FIRST	Who does he owe money to?	0	neutral
504	FIRST	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	0.674553	positive
505	FIRST	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.	0	neutral

617	FIRST	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	0	neutral

625	FIRST	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	0	neutral

627	FIRST	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	0	neutral
628	FIRST	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	-0.614322	negative

675	FIRST	These are felons.	-0.534012	negative
676	FIRST	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	-0.549168	negative

711	FIRST	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	-0.308106	negative
712	FIRST	We cannot just say law and order.	0	neutral

727	FIRST	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	-0.559834	negative
728	FIRST	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	-0.687868	negative
729	FIRST	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	-0.600683	negative
730	FIRST	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	-0.761578	negative

743	FIRST	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	0.761359	positive
744	FIRST	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0.599415	positive
745	FIRST	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	0.79382	positive
746	FIRST	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	0	neutral
747	FIRST	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	0	neutral

754	FIRST	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	-0.564891	negative
755	FIRST	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	-0.371752	negative
756	FIRST	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	-0.554672	negative
757	FIRST	But we went from 2,200 to 500.	0	neutral
758	FIRST	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	0	neutral
759	FIRST	And it was terminated by current mayor.	-0.295601	negative
760	FIRST	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	0	neutral
761	FIRST	Tremendous beyond belief.	0	neutral
762	FIRST	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	-0.481106	negative
763	FIRST	It had a very, very big impact.	0.609874	positive
764	FIRST	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	0	neutral
765	FIRST	So there is...	0	neutral
766	FIRST	No, you're wrong.	-0.71169	negative
767	FIRST	You're wrong.	-0.603244	negative

774	FIRST	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0	neutral
775	FIRST	Look, one murder is too many.	0	neutral
776	FIRST	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0.873837	positive
777	FIRST	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	-0.297556	negative
778	FIRST	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	0.433787	positive
779	FIRST	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	-0.559272	negative
780	FIRST	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	0.590432	positive
781	FIRST	This conversation is about race.	0	neutral

797	FIRST	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	0	neutral
798	FIRST	But I will tell you, I've been all over.	0	neutral
799	FIRST	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	0.661774	positive
800	FIRST	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	-0.745102	negative
801	FIRST	Mr. Trump, I...	0	neutral
802	FIRST	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	0.4375	positive
803	FIRST	And, yes, I did.	0	neutral
804	FIRST	And you know what else I prepared for?	0	neutral

824	FIRST	That was...	0	neutral
825	FIRST	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
826	FIRST	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	0.717866	positive
827	FIRST	I will let you respond.	0	neutral

834	FIRST	So the question is, what changed your mind?	0	neutral
835	FIRST	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	0	neutral
836	FIRST	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	0	neutral
837	FIRST	But nobody was caring much about it.	-0.445665	negative
838	FIRST	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	0	neutral
839	FIRST	And I think I did a good job.	0.687806	positive
840	FIRST	Secretary Clinton also fought it.	0	neutral

843	FIRST	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	0	neutral
844	FIRST	And she was involved.	0	neutral
845	FIRST	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	-0.632208	negative
846	FIRST	I'm sorry.	-0.848206	negative
847	FIRST	I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.	0.620858	positive

850	FIRST	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
851	FIRST	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	-0.373389	negative

853	FIRST	He should have produced it a long time before.	0	neutral
854	FIRST	I say nothing.	-0.48909	negative
855	FIRST	But let me just tell you.	0	neutral
856	FIRST	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0	neutral
857	FIRST	I think you can see that.	0	neutral
858	FIRST	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	-0.615737	negative

860	FIRST	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
861	FIRST	Well, just listen to what you heard.	0.580356	positive
862	FIRST	(LAUGHTER)	0	neutral
863	FIRST	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	-0.712539	negative
864	FIRST	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0	neutral
865	FIRST	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	0	neutral
866	FIRST	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	-0.411325	negative
867	FIRST	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	0	neutral
868	FIRST	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	0	neutral
869	FIRST	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	-0.313131	negative
870	FIRST	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	-0.884827	negative
871	FIRST	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	0.814919	positive
872	FIRST	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	-0.628063	negative
873	FIRST	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	0	neutral
874	FIRST	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	-0.507447	negative
875	FIRST	Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.	0.642958	positive
876	FIRST	I would love to respond.	0.45003	positive
877	FIRST	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	-0.413149	negative
878	FIRST	You treated him with terrible disrespect.	-0.562555	negative
879	FIRST	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	0.91834	positive
880	FIRST	It doesn't work that way.	-0.485162	negative
881	FIRST	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	0	neutral
882	FIRST	I don't think you can deny that.	-0.51051	negative
883	FIRST	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	0	neutral
884	FIRST	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	-0.688534	negative
885	FIRST	It really doesn't.	-0.593153	negative
886	FIRST	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	0	neutral
887	FIRST	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	-0.367604	negative
888	FIRST	It was very easy to do.	0.578012	positive
889	FIRST	I notice you bring that up a lot.	0	neutral
890	FIRST	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	-0.756317	negative
891	FIRST	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	-0.517127	negative
892	FIRST	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	-0.425205	negative
893	FIRST	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	0	neutral
894	FIRST	I'll go one step further.	0	neutral
895	FIRST	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	0.90936	positive
896	FIRST	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	-0.471299	negative

908	FIRST	Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.	0	neutral
909	FIRST	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	-0.77373	negative
910	FIRST	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	0	neutral
911	FIRST	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	-0.60362	negative
912	FIRST	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	-0.63301	negative
913	FIRST	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	-0.508007	negative

915	FIRST	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
916	FIRST	... tough, long game here.	-0.393809	negative
917	FIRST	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	-0.683657	negative
918	FIRST	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	-0.599217	negative
919	FIRST	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	0	neutral
920	FIRST	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	-0.734303	negative
921	FIRST	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	0.489355	positive
922	FIRST	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	0	neutral
923	FIRST	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	-0.376097	negative
924	FIRST	And the Russians need to understand that.	0	neutral
925	FIRST	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	0.577534	positive
926	FIRST	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	-0.766889	negative
927	FIRST	That is just unacceptable.	-0.822548	negative
928	FIRST	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	-0.413916	negative
929	FIRST	Your two minutes have expired.	-0.575161	negative

943	FIRST	OK?	0	neutral

949	FIRST	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	-0.318526	negative
950	FIRST	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	0	neutral

958	FIRST	That's what we learned.	0	neutral

960	FIRST	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	0.74098	positive

979	FIRST	We're making progress.	0.632705	positive

981	FIRST	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	0	neutral
982	FIRST	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	0	neutral
983	FIRST	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	0	neutral
984	FIRST	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	-0.329549	negative
985	FIRST	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	0.548138	positive
986	FIRST	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	-0.707597	negative
987	FIRST	You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.	-0.780429	negative
988	FIRST	I'll ask this to both of you.	0	neutral
989	FIRST	Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?	0	neutral
990	FIRST	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	0.762181	positive
991	FIRST	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	0	neutral
992	FIRST	We will take out ISIS.	0	neutral
993	FIRST	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	-0.707717	negative
994	FIRST	And ISIS was formed.	0	neutral
995	FIRST	So she talks about taking them out.	0	neutral
996	FIRST	She's been doing it a long time.	0	neutral
997	FIRST	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	-0.317434	negative
998	FIRST	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	-0.506498	negative
999	FIRST	And then you wouldn't have had them.	0	neutral
1000	FIRST	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	0	neutral
1001	FIRST	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	-0.790141	negative
1002	FIRST	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
1003	FIRST	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	0	neutral
1004	FIRST	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	0	neutral
1005	FIRST	Wrong.	-0.660069	negative
1006	FIRST	That is absolutely proved over and over again.	0	neutral
1007	FIRST	Wrong.	-0.660069	negative
1008	FIRST	Wrong.	-0.660069	negative
1009	FIRST	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	0	neutral
1010	FIRST	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	-0.568193	negative
1011	FIRST	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0	neutral
1012	FIRST	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	0	neutral
1013	FIRST	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	0	neutral
1014	FIRST	That's the most important part of this.	0.503415	positive
1015	FIRST	How do we prevent attacks?	-0.557764	negative
1016	FIRST	How do we protect our people?	-0.423333	negative
1017	FIRST	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	-0.626997	negative
1018	FIRST	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	0.598929	positive
1019	FIRST	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	0	neutral
1020	FIRST	And they brought him down.	0	neutral
1021	FIRST	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	0.693363	positive
1022	FIRST	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	0	neutral
1023	FIRST	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	-0.821507	negative
1024	FIRST	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	-0.822609	negative
1025	FIRST	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	0	neutral
1026	FIRST	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	0	neutral
1027	FIRST	They're on the front lines.	0	neutral
1028	FIRST	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0	neutral
1029	FIRST	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	-0.817247	negative
1030	FIRST	Mr. Trump...	0	neutral
1031	FIRST	Well, I have to respond.	0	neutral
1032	FIRST	Please respond.	0	neutral
1033	FIRST	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	0	neutral
1034	FIRST	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	-0.746739	negative
1035	FIRST	Under your direction, to a large extent.	0	neutral
1036	FIRST	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	-0.665818	negative
1037	FIRST	They were choking on the sanctions.	-0.51772	negative
1038	FIRST	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	0.564824	positive
1039	FIRST	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	0	neutral
1040	FIRST	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	0	neutral
1041	FIRST	I did really well.	0.565405	positive
1042	FIRST	But I have common sense.	-0.401923	negative
1043	FIRST	And I said, well, I'll tell you.	0.491154	positive
1044	FIRST	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	-0.337858	negative
1045	FIRST	But two things.	0	neutral
1046	FIRST	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	-0.514427	negative
1047	FIRST	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	-0.729553	negative
1048	FIRST	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	0	neutral
1049	FIRST	And I was very strong.	0.576491	positive
1050	FIRST	And I said it numerous times.	0	neutral
1051	FIRST	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	-0.402182	negative
1052	FIRST	And I think that's great.	0.695222	positive
1053	FIRST	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	0	neutral
1054	FIRST	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0	neutral
1055	FIRST	But I'm all for NATO.	0	neutral
1056	FIRST	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	-0.611952	negative
1057	FIRST	And they're going to do that.	0	neutral
1058	FIRST	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	-0.633155	negative
1059	FIRST	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	-0.565416	negative
1060	FIRST	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	0	neutral
1061	FIRST	Not only that, you named the day.	0	neutral
1062	FIRST	They couldn't believe it.	0	neutral
1063	FIRST	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	-0.712314	negative
1064	FIRST	They said...	0	neutral
1065	FIRST	Lester, we've covered...	0	neutral
1066	FIRST	No, wait a minute.	0	neutral
1067	FIRST	We've covered this ground.	0	neutral
1068	FIRST	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	0	neutral
1069	FIRST	It should have never happened.	0	neutral
1070	FIRST	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	0	neutral
1071	FIRST	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	0	neutral
1072	FIRST	Now it's in over 30 countries.	0	neutral
1073	FIRST	And you're going to stop them?	-0.354351	negative
1074	FIRST	I don't think so.	-0.425703	negative
1075	FIRST	Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.	0	neutral
1076	FIRST	You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.	0	neutral
1077	FIRST	What makes your...	0	neutral
1078	FIRST	I did not support the war in Iraq.	-0.543867	negative
1079	FIRST	In 2002...	0	neutral
1080	FIRST	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	0	neutral
1081	FIRST	My question is, since you supported it...	0	neutral
1082	FIRST	Just -- would you like to hear...	0	neutral
1083	FIRST	... why is your -- why is your judgment...	-0.675417	negative
1084	FIRST	Wait a minute.	0	neutral
1085	FIRST	I was against the war in Iraq.	-0.524809	negative
1086	FIRST	Just so you put it out.	0	neutral
1087	FIRST	The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...	-0.702356	negative
1088	FIRST	The record does not show that.	-0.423864	negative
1089	FIRST	Why was -- is your judgment any...	-0.596958	negative
1090	FIRST	The record shows that I'm right.	0.525181	positive
1091	FIRST	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	0	neutral
1092	FIRST	Essentially.	-0.295651	negative
1093	FIRST	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	0	neutral
1094	FIRST	We talked about the economy is more important.	0	neutral
1095	FIRST	I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.	-0.839436	negative
1096	FIRST	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	-0.798434	negative
1097	FIRST	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	-0.638547	negative
1098	FIRST	Why is your judgment better than...	-0.474552	negative
1099	FIRST	And when he -- excuse me.	-0.34196	negative
1100	FIRST	And that was before the war started.	0	neutral
1101	FIRST	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	-0.634631	negative
1102	FIRST	I was against the war.	-0.475669	negative
1103	FIRST	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	0	neutral
1104	FIRST	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	-0.458484	negative
1105	FIRST	But nobody called Sean Hannity.	-0.746942	negative
1106	FIRST	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	0	neutral
1107	FIRST	I think in '04.	0	neutral
1108	FIRST	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	-0.497877	negative
1109	FIRST	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	0	neutral
1110	FIRST	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	-0.737517	negative
1111	FIRST	He and I used to have arguments about the war.	0	neutral
1112	FIRST	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	-0.886323	negative
1113	FIRST	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	-0.570705	negative
1114	FIRST	And that's exactly what it's done.	0	neutral
1115	FIRST	It's been a disaster.	-0.710032	negative
1116	FIRST	My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...	0	neutral
1117	FIRST	No, no.	-0.40356	negative
1118	FIRST	You didn't hear what I said.	-0.581058	negative
1119	FIRST	Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?	-0.771094	negative
1120	FIRST	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	0.435617	positive
1121	FIRST	There's no question about that.	0	neutral
1122	FIRST	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0.628129	positive
1123	FIRST	(LAUGHTER)	0	neutral
1124	FIRST	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	0.773537	positive
1125	FIRST	I have a winning temperament.	0.784756	positive
1126	FIRST	I know how to win.	0	neutral
1127	FIRST	She does not have a...	-0.414334	negative
1128	FIRST	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
1129	FIRST	Wait.	0	neutral
1130	FIRST	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	0	neutral
1131	FIRST	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	-0.427696	negative
1132	FIRST	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
1133	FIRST	Whew, OK.	0	neutral
1134	FIRST	(LAUGHTER)	0	neutral
1135	FIRST	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	0	neutral
1136	FIRST	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	-0.692201	negative
1137	FIRST	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	0	neutral
1138	FIRST	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	-0.638254	negative
1139	FIRST	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	-0.318844	negative
1140	FIRST	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	-0.338857	negative
1141	FIRST	They had built covert facilities.	0	neutral
1142	FIRST	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	0	neutral
1143	FIRST	And we had sanctioned them.	0	neutral
1144	FIRST	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	-0.733912	negative
1145	FIRST	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	-0.473277	negative
1146	FIRST	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	0	neutral
1147	FIRST	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	0	neutral
1148	FIRST	That's diplomacy.	0	neutral
1149	FIRST	That's coalition-building.	0	neutral
1150	FIRST	That's working with other nations.	-0.303161	negative
1151	FIRST	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	-0.451992	negative
1152	FIRST	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	-0.676935	negative
1153	FIRST	That's not good judgment.	-0.717563	negative
1154	FIRST	That would not start a war.	-0.348732	negative
1155	FIRST	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	-0.603451	negative
1156	FIRST	And the worst part...	-0.80644	negative
1157	FIRST	No, they were taunting us.	-0.76458	negative
1158	FIRST	... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	0	neutral
1159	FIRST	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	-0.327971	negative
1160	FIRST	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	-0.676874	negative
1161	FIRST	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	0.706612	positive
1162	FIRST	Wrong.	-0.660069	negative
1163	FIRST	... have a good time, folks.	0.569363	positive
1164	FIRST	It's lies.	0	neutral
1165	FIRST	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	-0.750199	negative
1166	FIRST	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	-0.65538	negative
1167	FIRST	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	-0.745891	negative
1168	FIRST	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	0	neutral
1169	FIRST	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	-0.451874	negative
1170	FIRST	I would like to...	0	neutral
1171	FIRST	It's a good one, though.	0	neutral
1172	FIRST	It well describes the problem.	0	neutral
1173	FIRST	(LAUGHTER)	0	neutral
1174	FIRST	It's not an accurate one at all.	-0.368518	negative
1175	FIRST	It's not an accurate one.	-0.297751	negative
1176	FIRST	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	0	neutral
1177	FIRST	I agree with her on one thing.	0.448794	positive
1178	FIRST	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	0	neutral
1179	FIRST	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0	neutral
1180	FIRST	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	-0.319505	negative
1181	FIRST	They do not pay us.	-0.388858	negative
1182	FIRST	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	0	neutral
1183	FIRST	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	-0.898887	negative
1184	FIRST	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	-0.431	negative
1185	FIRST	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	-0.617183	negative
1186	FIRST	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	-0.480805	negative
1187	FIRST	We need to move on.	0	neutral
1188	FIRST	Well, wait, but it's very important.	0.616942	positive
1189	FIRST	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	-0.473993	negative
1190	FIRST	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	0	neutral
1191	FIRST	They have to help us out.	0	neutral
1192	FIRST	Our last...	-0.545584	negative
1193	FIRST	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	0	neutral
1194	FIRST	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	0	neutral
1195	FIRST	Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.	0	neutral
1196	FIRST	On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.	0	neutral
1197	FIRST	Do you support the current policy?	0	neutral
1198	FIRST	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.	0	neutral
1199	FIRST	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	0	neutral
1200	FIRST	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	0.59076	positive
1201	FIRST	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	0	neutral
1202	FIRST	I looked the other night.	0	neutral
1203	FIRST	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	0	neutral
1204	FIRST	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	-0.630691	negative
1205	FIRST	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	-0.41266	negative
1206	FIRST	But I would certainly not do first strike.	-0.511829	negative
1207	FIRST	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	0	neutral
1208	FIRST	At the same time, we have to be prepared.	0	neutral
1209	FIRST	I can't take anything off the table.	-0.629704	negative
1210	FIRST	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0	neutral
1211	FIRST	China should solve that problem for us.	-0.405044	negative
1212	FIRST	China should go into North Korea.	0	neutral
1213	FIRST	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	0.779374	positive
1214	FIRST	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	-0.546979	negative
1215	FIRST	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	-0.620778	negative
1216	FIRST	Iran has power over North Korea.	0	neutral
1217	FIRST	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0	neutral
1218	FIRST	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	0.487134	positive
1219	FIRST	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	-0.553113	negative
1220	FIRST	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	-0.549068	negative
1221	FIRST	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	0.673946	positive
1222	FIRST	Nobody's ever seen that before.	-0.532625	negative
1223	FIRST	That turned out to be wrong.	-0.57666	negative
1224	FIRST	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	-0.311074	negative
1225	FIRST	It certainly looks that way.	0	neutral
1226	FIRST	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	0	neutral
1227	FIRST	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	-0.807658	negative
1228	FIRST	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	0	neutral

83	VP	I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.	-0.740165	negative

172	VP	OK.	0	neutral
173	VP	According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.	0	neutral
174	VP	In fact, your plans would add even more to it.	-0.397867	negative
175	VP	Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.	0	neutral
176	VP	Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.	-0.429932	negative
177	VP	Governor Pence?	0	neutral
178	VP	I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.	-0.605491	negative
179	VP	I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.	0.896268	positive
180	VP	The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.	0.682763	positive
181	VP	We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.	0	neutral
182	VP	That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.	-0.443302	negative
183	VP	He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.	-0.478275	negative
184	VP	He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.	-0.539264	negative
185	VP	In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.	-0.351045	negative
186	VP	But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.	-0.778626	negative
187	VP	It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.	0	neutral
188	VP	You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.	-0.671899	negative
189	VP	But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.	-0.846425	negative
190	VP	But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.	-0.718445	negative
191	VP	They want to expand it into a single-payer program.	0	neutral
192	VP	And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.	0	neutral
193	VP	Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.	-0.841904	negative
194	VP	We can get America moving again.	0.469377	positive
195	VP	Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.	0.858768	positive
196	VP	And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.	0	neutral
197	VP	When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.	0	neutral
198	VP	Senator Kaine?	0	neutral
199	VP	Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.	0	neutral
200	VP	"Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump?"	0	neutral
201	VP	I think that's not such a hard choice.	0	neutral
202	VP	"Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan."	0	neutral
203	VP	Five components.	0	neutral
204	VP	First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.	0.795991	positive
205	VP	Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.	0.638374	positive
206	VP	Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.	-0.596699	negative
207	VP	Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.	0.85419	positive
208	VP	Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.	0	neutral
209	VP	My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.	0	neutral
210	VP	And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.	-0.7261	negative
211	VP	The Trump plan is a different plan.	0.697431	positive
212	VP	"It's a ""you're fired"" plan."	0	neutral
213	VP	And there's two key elements to it.	0	neutral
214	VP	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.	0	neutral
215	VP	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.	-0.789038	negative
216	VP	Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.	-0.332474	negative
217	VP	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.	0	neutral
218	VP	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.	-0.492057	negative
219	VP	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.	-0.519369	negative
220	VP	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.	0	neutral
221	VP	The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.	0.498819	positive
222	VP	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?	-0.466092	negative
223	VP	Because his tax plan basically helps him.	0	neutral
224	VP	And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.	0	neutral
225	VP	On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.	-0.585347	negative
226	VP	Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.	0	neutral
227	VP	Does that seem fair to you?	0.468234	positive
228	VP	"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator."	0.63933	positive
229	VP	You use that a whole lot.	0	neutral
230	VP	And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.	0	neutral
231	VP	Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.	-0.708616	negative
232	VP	And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table.	0	neutral
233	VP	I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.	-0.615858	negative
234	VP	We're in the...	0	neutral

245	VP	People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different.	0	neutral
246	VP	I mean, this economy is struggling.	-0.802488	negative
247	VP	The answer to this economy is not more taxes.	-0.535798	negative

249	VP	It's not more spending...	-0.66846	negative
250	VP	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral

252	VP	Absolutely I will.	0.518084	positive
253	VP	Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.	0.577815	positive
254	VP	Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine.	0	neutral
255	VP	And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician.	0	neutral
256	VP	He actually built a business.	0	neutral
257	VP	Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.	0	neutral

259	VP	We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.	0.604477	positive
260	VP	But why won't he release his tax returns?	-0.721391	negative
261	VP	Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...	0.664261	positive
262	VP	I do want to come back to that, but...	-0.327057	negative
263	VP	His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used.	-0.395231	negative

375	VP	I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.	0	neutral
376	VP	And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.	0	neutral
377	VP	We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.	-0.826936	negative

381	VP	Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.	0	neutral
382	VP	The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.	0.806282	positive
383	VP	You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.	0.703264	positive
384	VP	And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.	0.756403	positive
385	VP	That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.	0	neutral
386	VP	Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.	0	neutral
387	VP	That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.	-0.649198	negative
388	VP	So here's what we'll do.	0	neutral
389	VP	We'll focus on community policing.	0	neutral

391	VP	I'm a gun-owner.	0	neutral
392	VP	I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.	0	neutral
393	VP	But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.	-0.73066	negative
394	VP	And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.	0	neutral

408	VP	And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea.	0.618624	positive
409	VP	It's worked in the Hoosier state.	0	neutral
410	VP	And we fully support that.	0.724423	positive
411	VP	Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.	0.849181	positive
412	VP	It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.	0	neutral
413	VP	They see his commitment to law and order.	0.504954	positive
414	VP	But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.	-0.842097	negative
415	VP	And that really has got to stop.	-0.550916	negative
416	VP	I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.	0	neutral

418	VP	We -- we grieve with those who grieve.	-0.420671	negative
419	VP	And we're saddened at the loss of life.	-0.796951	negative
420	VP	But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.	-0.502001	negative
421	VP	I just think...	0	neutral

425	VP	But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.	0	neutral

432	VP	The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school.	0	neutral

436	VP	But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.	-0.659266	negative

1106	VP	It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.	0	neutral
1107	VP	And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.	0	neutral

1120	VP	And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.	0	neutral
1121	VP	When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...	-0.467322	negative
1122	VP	Governor, your two minutes are up.	0	neutral

1147	VP	The Trump Foundation is non-profit.	0.49569	positive
1148	VP	In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.	0.570079	positive
1149	VP	The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.	-0.418664	negative
1150	VP	They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.	-0.748578	negative
1151	VP	And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.	0	neutral
1152	VP	This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.	0	neutral
1153	VP	Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.	0	neutral

1164	VP	It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.	-0.46084	negative

1170	VP	Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?	-0.386314	negative

1172	VP	You have to.	0	neutral
1173	VP	A president has to do that.	0	neutral
1174	VP	Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.	0	neutral
1175	VP	You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.	0	neutral
1176	VP	I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0	neutral
1177	VP	We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.	0	neutral
1178	VP	And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.	0.577467	positive
1179	VP	Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.	-0.47082	negative
1180	VP	They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.	-0.493737	negative
1181	VP	So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.	0	neutral
1182	VP	So we're working together with China, and we need to.	0	neutral
1183	VP	China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.	0	neutral
1184	VP	Hillary understands that very well.	0.847016	positive
1185	VP	"She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights."""	0	neutral
1186	VP	They didn't want her to say that, but she did.	0	neutral

1188	VP	And that's what it's going to take.	0	neutral
1189	VP	The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.	-0.366403	negative
1190	VP	I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.	-0.436353	negative

1205	VP	I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.	0.761804	positive
1206	VP	But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.	-0.510555	negative
1207	VP	For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.	-0.707981	negative
1208	VP	But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.	-0.83404	negative
1209	VP	And so I had to grapple with that.	-0.493803	negative
1210	VP	When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.	0	neutral
1211	VP	But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.	0	neutral
1212	VP	I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.	0	neutral
1213	VP	And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.	0	neutral
1214	VP	And I was elected, and I did.	0	neutral
1215	VP	It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.	-0.628344	negative
1216	VP	That was a real struggle.	-0.578882	negative
1217	VP	But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.	0.688525	positive
1218	VP	Governor Pence?	0	neutral
1219	VP	Well, it's a wonderful question.	0.853961	positive
1220	VP	And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.	0.845414	positive
1221	VP	I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.	0.86071	positive
1222	VP	It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.	0.637581	positive
1223	VP	But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.	0	neutral
1224	VP	And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.	-0.408096	negative
1225	VP	And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.	0.830882	positive
1226	VP	And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.	0.961069	positive
1227	VP	I truly do.	0.686973	positive
1228	VP	That's shared.	0	neutral
1229	VP	But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.	0.850176	positive
1230	VP	The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.	0.694172	positive
1231	VP	I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.	0.882402	positive
1232	VP	I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.	0	neutral
1233	VP	But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.	-0.421808	negative
1234	VP	I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.	-0.62238	negative
1235	VP	And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.	-0.495315	negative
1236	VP	Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.	-0.359189	negative
1237	VP	But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.	-0.843583	negative
1238	VP	So for me, my faith informs my life.	0.803829	positive
1239	VP	I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.	-0.702668	negative
1240	VP	But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.	0.954407	positive
1241	VP	Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.	0.784931	positive
1242	VP	Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.	0	neutral
1243	VP	But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.	0.897396	positive
1244	VP	But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.	0	neutral
1245	VP	So let's talk about abortion and choice.	0	neutral
1246	VP	Let's talk about them.	0	neutral
1247	VP	We support Roe v. Wade.	0	neutral
1248	VP	We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.	0.665456	positive
1249	VP	That's something we trust American women to do that.	0.56518	positive
1250	VP	And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.	-0.755281	negative
1251	VP	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.	0	neutral
1252	VP	He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.	-0.302813	negative

1254	VP	This is pretty important.	0.818389	positive
1255	VP	Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.	-0.788394	negative
1256	VP	I think you should live your moral values.	0.661217	positive
1257	VP	But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.	-0.755439	negative
1258	VP	And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.	-0.600571	negative
1259	VP	No, it's really not.	-0.633723	negative
1260	VP	Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.	-0.769569	negative

1286	VP	I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.	0.695384	positive
1287	VP	It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.	0.869415	positive
1288	VP	And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.	0	neutral
1289	VP	People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.	0	neutral

116	SECOND	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	-0.363549	negative
117	SECOND	So this is who Donald Trump is.	0	neutral
118	SECOND	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	-0.416077	negative

186	SECOND	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	-0.373626	negative
187	SECOND	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.	0	neutral
188	SECOND	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	0	neutral
189	SECOND	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.	0	neutral
190	SECOND	So you really owe him an apology.	0	neutral
191	SECOND	You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.	0	neutral
192	SECOND	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	0	neutral
193	SECOND	Number two, Michelle Obama.	-0.293423	negative
194	SECOND	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.	0	neutral
195	SECOND	And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.	0.68159	positive
196	SECOND	So, you talk about friend?	0	neutral
197	SECOND	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	0	neutral
198	SECOND	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	0	neutral
199	SECOND	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.	0	neutral
200	SECOND	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	-0.820565	negative
201	SECOND	And I'll tell you what.	0	neutral
202	SECOND	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	-0.78818	negative
203	SECOND	But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.	-0.457332	negative
204	SECOND	There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.	-0.329982	negative
205	SECOND	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	-0.66607	negative
206	SECOND	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	-0.78005	negative
207	SECOND	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	-0.736729	negative
208	SECOND	So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?	0.792665	positive
209	SECOND	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.	0	neutral
210	SECOND	And it's a disgrace.	-0.637971	negative
211	SECOND	And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.	-0.455903	negative
212	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.	-0.458359	negative
213	SECOND	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
214	SECOND	I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.	0	neutral

220	SECOND	... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	-0.678325	negative
221	SECOND	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	-0.39825	negative
222	SECOND	So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.	0	neutral
223	SECOND	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0	neutral
224	SECOND	Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.	0	neutral
225	SECOND	Because you'd be in jail.	0	neutral
226	SECOND	(APPLAUSE)	0	neutral
227	SECOND	Secretary Clinton...	-0.395276	negative
228	SECOND	We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.	0	neutral
229	SECOND	Please do not applaud.	0	neutral
230	SECOND	You're just wasting time.	-0.684442	negative
231	SECOND	And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.	-0.408934	negative
232	SECOND	You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.	-0.654953	negative
233	SECOND	"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."""	-0.579363	negative
234	SECOND	The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.	-0.421907	negative
235	SECOND	You don't call that extremely careless?	-0.752542	negative
236	SECOND	Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.	-0.524864	negative
237	SECOND	Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.	-0.562126	negative
238	SECOND	I'm not making any excuses.	-0.625287	negative
239	SECOND	It was a mistake.	-0.736417	negative
240	SECOND	And I am very sorry about that.	-0.867132	negative
241	SECOND	But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.	0	neutral
242	SECOND	After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.	-0.744031	negative
243	SECOND	I take classified materials very seriously and always have.	0	neutral
244	SECOND	When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.	-0.450685	negative
245	SECOND	Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.	0	neutral
246	SECOND	So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.	0	neutral
247	SECOND	And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.	-0.571838	negative
248	SECOND	OK, we're going to move on.	0.466937	positive
249	SECOND	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	0	neutral
250	SECOND	Right?	0.464437	positive
251	SECOND	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	-0.490667	negative
252	SECOND	You know, it's amazing.	0.662095	positive
253	SECOND	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.	0	neutral
254	SECOND	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	0	neutral
255	SECOND	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	-0.30363	negative
256	SECOND	I don't think so.	-0.425703	negative
257	SECOND	She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.	0	neutral
258	SECOND	Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.	0	neutral
259	SECOND	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	-0.430251	negative
260	SECOND	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	0	neutral
261	SECOND	That wasn't before.	0	neutral
262	SECOND	That was after.	0	neutral
263	SECOND	She got it from the United States Congress.	0	neutral
264	SECOND	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	-0.806202	negative
265	SECOND	Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.	0	neutral
266	SECOND	But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.	-0.632312	negative
267	SECOND	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	0	neutral
268	SECOND	We have to move on.	0	neutral
269	SECOND	You did that.	0	neutral
270	SECOND	Wait a minute.	0	neutral
271	SECOND	One second.	0	neutral
272	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.	0	neutral
273	SECOND	We want to give the audience a chance.	0	neutral
274	SECOND	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	-0.357882	negative
275	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, you can respond.	0	neutral
276	SECOND	Then we have to move on to an audience question.	0	neutral
277	SECOND	Look, it's just not true.	0	neutral
278	SECOND	And so please, go to...	-0.470512	negative
279	SECOND	Oh, you didn't delete them?	-0.475609	negative
280	SECOND	Allow her to respond, please.	0	neutral
281	SECOND	It was personal e-mails, not official.	0	neutral
282	SECOND	Oh, 33,000?	-0.439234	negative
283	SECOND	Yeah.	0	neutral
284	SECOND	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	-0.384878	negative
285	SECOND	Oh, yeah.	0	neutral
286	SECOND	What about the other 15,000?	0	neutral
287	SECOND	Please allow her to respond.	0	neutral
288	SECOND	She didn't talk while you talked.	-0.320353	negative
289	SECOND	Yes, that's true, I didn't.	0	neutral
290	SECOND	Because you have nothing to say.	0	neutral
291	SECOND	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	-0.604412	negative
292	SECOND	Get off this question.	0	neutral
293	SECOND	OK, Donald.	0	neutral
294	SECOND	I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.	-0.794483	negative
295	SECOND	But let's at least focus...	-0.564828	negative
296	SECOND	Let's see what happens...	0	neutral
297	SECOND	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
298	SECOND	Allow her to respond.	0	neutral
299	SECOND	... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.	0	neutral
300	SECOND	Let's get to their questions.	0	neutral
301	SECOND	We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.	0	neutral

305	SECOND	I'd like to know.	0	neutral
306	SECOND	Why aren't you bringing...	-0.711992	negative
307	SECOND	We brought up the e-mails.	0	neutral
308	SECOND	No, it hasn't.	-0.545256	negative
309	SECOND	It hasn't.	-0.501246	negative
310	SECOND	And it hasn't been finished at all.	0	neutral
311	SECOND	Ken Karpowicz has a question.	0	neutral
312	SECOND	It's nice to -- one on three.	0	neutral
313	SECOND	Thank you.	0.75598	positive
314	SECOND	Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.	0	neutral

317	SECOND	Copays have gone up.	-0.487392	negative
318	SECOND	Prescriptions have gone up.	-0.463382	negative
319	SECOND	And the coverage has gone down.	-0.749602	negative
320	SECOND	What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?	0.676003	positive
321	SECOND	That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.	-0.604063	negative
322	SECOND	If he wants to start, he can start.	0	neutral
323	SECOND	No, go ahead, Donald.	-0.339847	negative
324	SECOND	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	-0.313995	negative
325	SECOND	Go ahead.	0.624016	positive
326	SECOND	(LAUGHTER)	0	neutral
327	SECOND	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
328	SECOND	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0	neutral
329	SECOND	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	0	neutral
330	SECOND	Premiums have gotten too high.	0	neutral
331	SECOND	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	-0.551413	negative
332	SECOND	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	0	neutral
333	SECOND	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	0	neutral
334	SECOND	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	0.553437	positive
335	SECOND	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	0.861194	positive
336	SECOND	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	-0.367988	negative
337	SECOND	Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.	0	neutral
338	SECOND	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	0.696966	positive
339	SECOND	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	0	neutral
340	SECOND	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0.875242	positive
341	SECOND	But we've got to get costs down.	0	neutral
342	SECOND	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	0.827517	positive
343	SECOND	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	-0.46057	negative
344	SECOND	And then we would have to start all over again.	0	neutral
345	SECOND	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	0.683267	positive
346	SECOND	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	0.635881	positive
347	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, your time is up.	0	neutral
348	SECOND	So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.	0	neutral
349	SECOND	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0	neutral
350	SECOND	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	0	neutral
351	SECOND	Obamacare is a disaster.	-0.841316	negative
352	SECOND	You know it.	0	neutral
353	SECOND	We all know it.	0	neutral
354	SECOND	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.	-0.449815	negative
355	SECOND	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.	0	neutral
356	SECOND	It's only getting worse.	-0.741261	negative
357	SECOND	In '17, it implodes by itself.	-0.63118	negative
358	SECOND	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	0	neutral
359	SECOND	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	0	neutral
360	SECOND	Obamacare will never work.	-0.634833	negative
361	SECOND	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	-0.857949	negative
362	SECOND	Far too expensive.	-0.714524	negative
363	SECOND	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	-0.631267	negative
364	SECOND	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.	0	neutral
365	SECOND	We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.	0	neutral
366	SECOND	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	-0.348856	negative
367	SECOND	We want competition.	0	neutral
368	SECOND	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	0.724838	positive
369	SECOND	She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.	-0.654636	negative
370	SECOND	And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.	-0.738709	negative
371	SECOND	It's catastrophic in certain ways.	-0.713188	negative
372	SECOND	But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.	-0.624016	negative
373	SECOND	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.	-0.326488	negative
374	SECOND	Obamacare was the first step.	-0.550826	negative
375	SECOND	Obamacare is a total disaster.	-0.821899	negative
376	SECOND	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	-0.641487	negative
377	SECOND	Mr. Trump, your time...	0	neutral
378	SECOND	It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.	-0.362092	negative
379	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.	0	neutral
380	SECOND	"Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half."	-0.688374	negative
381	SECOND	Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?	-0.632621	negative
382	SECOND	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	-0.358698	negative
383	SECOND	And it's very clear.	0.689835	positive
384	SECOND	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	0.7586	positive
385	SECOND	But we have an employer-based system.	0	neutral
386	SECOND	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	0	neutral
387	SECOND	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	0	neutral
388	SECOND	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	0	neutral
389	SECOND	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.	-0.422893	negative
390	SECOND	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	0.501427	positive
391	SECOND	So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...	-0.564148	negative
392	SECOND	Secretary Clinton...	-0.395276	negative
393	SECOND	... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	-0.872561	negative
394	SECOND	Your time is up.	0	neutral
395	SECOND	... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.	-0.480725	negative
396	SECOND	So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.	-0.611286	negative
397	SECOND	That's not going to work.	-0.60885	negative
398	SECOND	Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.	0	neutral
399	SECOND	Well, I just want -- just one thing.	0	neutral
400	SECOND	First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.	-0.658584	negative
401	SECOND	Everything.	0	neutral
402	SECOND	Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.	-0.759953	negative
403	SECOND	This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.	-0.471894	negative
404	SECOND	You've said you want to end Obamacare...	-0.669484	negative
405	SECOND	By the way...	0	neutral
406	SECOND	You've said you want to end Obamacare.	-0.664174	negative
407	SECOND	You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.	0	neutral
408	SECOND	How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?	0	neutral
409	SECOND	We're going to be able to.	0	neutral
410	SECOND	You're going to have plans...	0	neutral
411	SECOND	What does that mean?	-0.453364	negative
412	SECOND	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	0.58211	positive
413	SECOND	You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.	0.762985	positive
414	SECOND	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	-0.739863	negative
415	SECOND	Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?	0.616314	positive
416	SECOND	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	-0.373903	negative
417	SECOND	President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.	-0.472205	negative
418	SECOND	You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.	0	neutral
419	SECOND	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	0	neutral
420	SECOND	The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.	-0.362538	negative
421	SECOND	But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.	0	neutral
422	SECOND	And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.	0	neutral
423	SECOND	We're going to block grant into the states.	0	neutral
424	SECOND	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...	-0.47512	negative
425	SECOND	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0.751399	positive

427	SECOND	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0.751399	positive
428	SECOND	We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.	0	neutral
429	SECOND	Hi.	0.522967	positive
430	SECOND	There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.	0	neutral
431	SECOND	You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?	-0.689227	negative
432	SECOND	Mr. Trump, you're first.	0	neutral
433	SECOND	Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.	-0.772065	negative
434	SECOND	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	-0.298241	negative
435	SECOND	I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.	0	neutral
436	SECOND	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	0	neutral
437	SECOND	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	-0.634522	negative
438	SECOND	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	-0.698433	negative
439	SECOND	Horribly wounded.	0	neutral
440	SECOND	They'll never be the same.	0	neutral
441	SECOND	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	-0.526149	negative
442	SECOND	And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.	0	neutral
443	SECOND	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	0	neutral
444	SECOND	Go outside.	0	neutral
445	SECOND	Look at Paris.	0	neutral
446	SECOND	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	-0.786607	negative
447	SECOND	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.	-0.692622	negative
448	SECOND	"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""	0	neutral
449	SECOND	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	-0.57324	negative
450	SECOND	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	-0.417606	negative
451	SECOND	But the name is there.	0	neutral
452	SECOND	It's radical Islamic terror.	-0.549122	negative
453	SECOND	And before you solve it, you have to say the name.	0	neutral
454	SECOND	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
455	SECOND	Well, thank you for asking your question.	0.834341	positive
456	SECOND	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	-0.915329	negative
457	SECOND	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	0	neutral
458	SECOND	I want to say just a couple of things.	0	neutral
459	SECOND	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	0	neutral
460	SECOND	And we've had many successful Muslims.	0	neutral
461	SECOND	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	-0.317074	negative
462	SECOND	My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.	0.927155	positive
463	SECOND	That's what America is.	0	neutral
464	SECOND	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	0.50845	positive
465	SECOND	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.	-0.703911	negative
466	SECOND	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	0	neutral
467	SECOND	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	0	neutral
468	SECOND	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	0.596653	positive
469	SECOND	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	0	neutral
470	SECOND	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	0	neutral
471	SECOND	And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.	0	neutral
472	SECOND	We are not at war with Islam.	0	neutral
473	SECOND	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	-0.826518	negative
474	SECOND	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.	0.49483	positive
475	SECOND	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0.543778	positive
476	SECOND	Mr. Trump, in December, you said this.	0	neutral
477	SECOND	Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.	-0.635683	negative
478	SECOND	We have no choice.	0	neutral
479	SECOND	We have no choice.	0	neutral
480	SECOND	Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.	0	neutral
481	SECOND	Is that correct?	0.53138	positive
482	SECOND	And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?	-0.696537	negative
483	SECOND	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	0	neutral
484	SECOND	Iraq was disaster.	-0.476091	negative
485	SECOND	So he would have been alive today.	0	neutral
486	SECOND	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	-0.587346	negative
487	SECOND	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	-0.684005	negative
488	SECOND	Excuse me..	0	neutral
489	SECOND	And why did it morph into that?	-0.635215	negative
490	SECOND	No, did you -- no, answer the question.	-0.327139	negative
491	SECOND	Do you still believe...	0	neutral

493	SECOND	You interrupt me all the time.	-0.41593	negative
494	SECOND	I do.	0	neutral
495	SECOND	Why don't you interrupt her?	-0.655827	negative
496	SECOND	Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?	0	neutral
497	SECOND	It's called extreme vetting.	-0.34124	negative
498	SECOND	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.	-0.463835	negative
499	SECOND	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	-0.750739	negative
500	SECOND	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	-0.606115	negative
501	SECOND	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.	0.50761	positive
502	SECOND	We have enough problems in this country.	-0.338922	negative
503	SECOND	I believe in building safe zones.	0.453099	positive
504	SECOND	I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.	0	neutral
505	SECOND	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	-0.711207	negative
506	SECOND	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.	0	neutral
507	SECOND	And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.	0	neutral
508	SECOND	We know you want tougher vetting.	0	neutral
509	SECOND	That's not a perfect system.	0	neutral
510	SECOND	So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?	-0.733182	negative
511	SECOND	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	-0.411886	negative
512	SECOND	But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.	-0.322119	negative
513	SECOND	There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.	-0.824681	negative
514	SECOND	And we need to do our part.	0	neutral
515	SECOND	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.	0	neutral
516	SECOND	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	-0.479637	negative
517	SECOND	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	0.483238	positive
518	SECOND	How do you do that?	0	neutral
519	SECOND	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.	0	neutral
520	SECOND	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	0	neutral
521	SECOND	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	0	neutral
522	SECOND	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	0	neutral
523	SECOND	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.	-0.797795	negative
524	SECOND	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.	-0.671009	negative
525	SECOND	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	-0.488454	negative
526	SECOND	We have it on tape.	0	neutral
527	SECOND	The entire press corps has looked at it.	0	neutral
528	SECOND	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	-0.514257	negative
529	SECOND	That's not been debunked.	0	neutral
530	SECOND	So, please...	-0.371581	negative
531	SECOND	That has not been debunked.	0	neutral

543	SECOND	Could I just respond to this, please?	-0.405029	negative
544	SECOND	Very quickly, please.	0	neutral
545	SECOND	Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.	-0.709823	negative
546	SECOND	When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.	-0.443236	negative
547	SECOND	In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.	-0.613616	negative
548	SECOND	And they don't want them.	0	neutral
549	SECOND	And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.	-0.542823	negative
550	SECOND	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0.539618	positive
551	SECOND	They're murderers and some very bad people.	-0.776276	negative
552	SECOND	And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.	-0.696477	negative
553	SECOND	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	0	neutral
554	SECOND	At a record clip.	0	neutral

566	SECOND	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0.751399	positive
567	SECOND	I want to move on.	-0.343665	negative
568	SECOND	This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes.	0	neutral
569	SECOND	This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.	0	neutral
570	SECOND	So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?	-0.56428	negative
571	SECOND	Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?	0	neutral
572	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.	-0.315721	negative

574	SECOND	"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""	0	neutral
575	SECOND	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.	0	neutral
576	SECOND	It was principled, and it was strategic.	0	neutral
577	SECOND	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.	-0.541376	negative
578	SECOND	And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.	0	neutral
579	SECOND	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	0.783163	positive
580	SECOND	But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.	-0.329941	negative
581	SECOND	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	-0.359356	negative
582	SECOND	We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.	-0.545139	negative
583	SECOND	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	0	neutral
584	SECOND	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.	0	neutral
585	SECOND	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	-0.48472	negative
586	SECOND	But we deserve answers.	-0.451772	negative
587	SECOND	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...	0.624271	positive

604	SECOND	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.	0	neutral
605	SECOND	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0.546141	positive
606	SECOND	But I don't know Putin.	0	neutral
607	SECOND	But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.	-0.707796	negative
608	SECOND	Maybe there is no hacking.	-0.31199	negative
609	SECOND	But they always blame Russia.	-0.394918	negative

617	SECOND	One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.	0	neutral
618	SECOND	But I have no loans with Russia.	0	neutral
619	SECOND	You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.	0	neutral

636	SECOND	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0	neutral
637	SECOND	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	0	neutral
638	SECOND	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	0.829767	positive

643	SECOND	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	-0.469155	negative
644	SECOND	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	0.545844	positive
645	SECOND	And I do.	0	neutral
646	SECOND	You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.	-0.337905	negative

649	SECOND	You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.	-0.4196	negative

655	SECOND	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	-0.410442	negative
656	SECOND	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	-0.769739	negative
657	SECOND	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	0	neutral
658	SECOND	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	-0.411721	negative

678	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0	neutral
679	SECOND	The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?	0	neutral
680	SECOND	Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.	0	neutral
681	SECOND	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	-0.383987	negative
682	SECOND	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	0	neutral
683	SECOND	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.	0	neutral
684	SECOND	His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.	-0.765973	negative
685	SECOND	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0	neutral
686	SECOND	And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.	-0.827711	negative
687	SECOND	Now, here's what I want to do.	-0.339969	negative
688	SECOND	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	-0.64304	negative
689	SECOND	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	-0.337733	negative
690	SECOND	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	-0.386235	negative
691	SECOND	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	-0.799113	negative
692	SECOND	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	-0.537111	negative
693	SECOND	It's called the Buffett rule.	0	neutral

695	SECOND	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	0	neutral
696	SECOND	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	-0.48495	negative
697	SECOND	I want to invest in hard-working families.	0.539618	positive
698	SECOND	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	-0.565721	negative
699	SECOND	And we need to reverse that.	0	neutral
700	SECOND	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	-0.725128	negative
701	SECOND	Thank you, Secretary.	0.652906	positive

706	SECOND	In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.	-0.396917	negative
707	SECOND	The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.	0	neutral
708	SECOND	They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.	-0.685309	negative
709	SECOND	You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.	-0.651248	negative
710	SECOND	You have not answered, though, a simple question.	0	neutral
711	SECOND	Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?	-0.819986	negative
712	SECOND	Of course I do.	0.468007	positive
713	SECOND	Of course I do.	0.468007	positive
714	SECOND	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	0	neutral
715	SECOND	I know many of her donors.	0	neutral
716	SECOND	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	-0.443566	negative
717	SECOND	So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?	-0.490555	negative
718	SECOND	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	0	neutral
719	SECOND	And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.	0	neutral
720	SECOND	That's why.	-0.555059	negative
721	SECOND	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0.624242	positive
722	SECOND	Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.	0	neutral
723	SECOND	But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.	-0.362684	negative
724	SECOND	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.	-0.316967	negative
725	SECOND	But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.	0	neutral
726	SECOND	I absolutely used it.	0	neutral
727	SECOND	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	-0.507204	negative
728	SECOND	Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.	-0.387367	negative
729	SECOND	So we won't make them famous.	-0.315627	negative
730	SECOND	So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?	-0.655598	negative
731	SECOND	No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.	-0.374993	negative
732	SECOND	But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.	0.766191	positive
733	SECOND	I love depreciation.	0.632364	positive
734	SECOND	You know, she's given it to us.	0	neutral
735	SECOND	Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.	0	neutral
736	SECOND	I say it all the time.	0	neutral

738	SECOND	Why didn't she do something about it?	-0.629539	negative
739	SECOND	She talks about taxes.	0	neutral
740	SECOND	Why didn't she do something about it?	-0.629539	negative
741	SECOND	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	-0.608539	negative
742	SECOND	With her, it's all talk and no action.	-0.403327	negative
743	SECOND	In the past...	0	neutral
744	SECOND	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	-0.767321	negative
745	SECOND	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.	0	neutral
746	SECOND	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	-0.607837	negative
747	SECOND	I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.	-0.529846	negative
748	SECOND	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	-0.459148	negative
749	SECOND	Congratulations.	0.69853	positive

759	SECOND	Oh, really?	-0.456057	negative
760	SECOND	I will be the president and we will get it done.	0	neutral
761	SECOND	That's exactly right.	0.65391	positive
762	SECOND	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0.81192	positive
763	SECOND	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0.565107	positive

777	SECOND	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	0	neutral

780	SECOND	I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.	0.48336	positive

787	SECOND	This is about the audience.	0	neutral

790	SECOND	A disaster.	-0.760811	negative
791	SECOND	Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.	0.569867	positive

798	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.	0	neutral
799	SECOND	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	-0.695414	negative
800	SECOND	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	-0.641125	negative
801	SECOND	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	-0.812943	negative
802	SECOND	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	0	neutral
803	SECOND	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	0	neutral
804	SECOND	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	0	neutral
805	SECOND	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	-0.439193	negative
806	SECOND	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	0	neutral

810	SECOND	I've stood up to Russia.	0	neutral
811	SECOND	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0	neutral
812	SECOND	I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.	0.673888	positive
813	SECOND	And I did as secretary of state.	0	neutral
814	SECOND	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	0	neutral
815	SECOND	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	-0.404072	negative
816	SECOND	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	0	neutral
817	SECOND	But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.	-0.735224	negative

830	SECOND	Obama draws the line in the sand.	0	neutral
831	SECOND	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0	neutral
832	SECOND	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	0	neutral

834	SECOND	Not good.	-0.721158	negative
835	SECOND	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	-0.461563	negative

845	SECOND	And you know what happens?	0	neutral
846	SECOND	They end up being worse than the people.	-0.744055	negative
847	SECOND	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	-0.334635	negative
848	SECOND	Gadhafi's out.	-0.585265	negative
849	SECOND	It's a mess.	-0.843745	negative
850	SECOND	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.	0.639187	positive
851	SECOND	I'm sure you probably have heard that.	0	neutral
852	SECOND	It was a disaster.	-0.572041	negative
853	SECOND	Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.	-0.819887	negative
854	SECOND	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	0	neutral

858	SECOND	But look at that deal.	0.616922	positive

952	SECOND	I would go after Baghdadi.	0	neutral

954	SECOND	So I think that could help.	0	neutral
955	SECOND	I would also consider arming the Kurds.	0	neutral
956	SECOND	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	0	neutral
957	SECOND	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	-0.410522	negative

1171	SECOND	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	-0.469816	negative
1172	SECOND	What I ask is this.	0	neutral
1173	SECOND	So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.	0	neutral
1174	SECOND	Pretty much self-funding money.	0.542416	positive
1175	SECOND	We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.	0.535717	positive
1176	SECOND	I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.	-0.574447	negative
1177	SECOND	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	0	neutral
1178	SECOND	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	-0.829905	negative
1179	SECOND	It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.	0	neutral
1180	SECOND	Why aren't you putting some money in?	-0.708456	negative
1181	SECOND	You have a lot of it.	0	neutral
1182	SECOND	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.	0	neutral
1183	SECOND	Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.	0	neutral
1184	SECOND	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?	-0.770325	negative
1185	SECOND	I'm just curious.	-0.29714	negative
1186	SECOND	Well...	0.434701	positive
1187	SECOND	(CROSSTALK)	0	neutral
1188	SECOND	Thank you very much.	0.729827	positive
1189	SECOND	We're going to get on to one more question.	0	neutral
1190	SECOND	The question was about the Supreme Court.	0	neutral
1191	SECOND	And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.	0	neutral
1192	SECOND	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	0	neutral
1193	SECOND	Thank you.	0.75598	positive
1194	SECOND	We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.	0	neutral
1195	SECOND	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	0	neutral
1196	SECOND	We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.	0	neutral
1197	SECOND	Ken?	-0.305412	negative
1198	SECOND	What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?	0	neutral
1199	SECOND	Mr. Trump, two minutes?	0	neutral
1200	SECOND	Absolutely.	0	neutral
1201	SECOND	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	0	neutral
1202	SECOND	Under absolutely siege.	-0.450318	negative
1203	SECOND	The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.	0	neutral
1204	SECOND	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.	0.537873	positive
1205	SECOND	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.	-0.715069	negative
1206	SECOND	Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.	0	neutral
1207	SECOND	But we need much more than wind and solar.	-0.405985	negative
1208	SECOND	And you look at our miners.	0	neutral
1209	SECOND	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	-0.607113	negative
1210	SECOND	There is a thing called clean coal.	0	neutral
1211	SECOND	Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.	-0.351835	negative
1212	SECOND	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.	0.440782	positive
1213	SECOND	We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.	0.442855	positive
1214	SECOND	So good.	0.606818	positive
1215	SECOND	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.	-0.325377	negative
1216	SECOND	I will bring our energy companies back.	0	neutral
1217	SECOND	They'll be able to compete.	0	neutral
1218	SECOND	They'll make money.	0	neutral
1219	SECOND	They'll pay off our national debt.	0	neutral
1220	SECOND	They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.	0	neutral
1221	SECOND	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	0.523122	positive
1222	SECOND	We have to bring back our workers.	-0.381589	negative
1223	SECOND	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	0	neutral
1224	SECOND	We have to guard our energy companies.	0	neutral
1225	SECOND	We have to make it possible.	0	neutral
1226	SECOND	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	-0.613136	negative
1227	SECOND	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	0.880429	positive
1228	SECOND	It's a disgrace.	-0.675961	negative
1229	SECOND	Your time is up.	0	neutral
1230	SECOND	Thank you.	0.75598	positive
1231	SECOND	It's an absolute disgrace.	-0.569331	negative
1232	SECOND	Secretary Clinton, two minutes.	0	neutral
1233	SECOND	And actually -- well, that was very interesting.	0.831954	positive
1234	SECOND	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	0.477282	positive
1235	SECOND	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	0	neutral
1236	SECOND	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	0.708019	positive
1237	SECOND	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	0	neutral
1238	SECOND	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	0	neutral
1239	SECOND	So the price of oil has been way down.	-0.405622	negative
1240	SECOND	And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?	-0.614604	negative
1241	SECOND	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	0.432216	positive
1242	SECOND	And I think that's an important transition.	0	neutral
1243	SECOND	We've got to remain energy-independent.	0	neutral
1244	SECOND	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.	0	neutral
1245	SECOND	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0	neutral
1246	SECOND	So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.	-0.428304	negative
1247	SECOND	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0.901387	positive
1248	SECOND	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	0	neutral
1249	SECOND	That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.	-0.454897	negative
1250	SECOND	A lot of them lost their lives.	-0.735517	negative
1251	SECOND	They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.	0	neutral
1252	SECOND	I don't want to walk away from them.	-0.488841	negative
1253	SECOND	So we've got to do something for them.	0	neutral
1254	SECOND	Secretary Clinton...	-0.395276	negative
1255	SECOND	But the price of coal is down worldwide.	-0.494158	negative
1256	SECOND	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	0.569352	positive
1257	SECOND	Your time is up.	0	neutral
1258	SECOND	And that's exactly what I have proposed.	0	neutral
1259	SECOND	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0.673569	positive
1260	SECOND	Time is up.	0	neutral
1261	SECOND	We have time for one more...	0	neutral
1262	SECOND	We have...	-0.315969	negative
1263	SECOND	One more audience question.	0	neutral
1264	SECOND	We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.	0	neutral
1265	SECOND	Good evening.	0	neutral
1266	SECOND	My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?	0	neutral
1267	SECOND	(APPLAUSE)	0	neutral
1268	SECOND	Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?	0.451223	positive
1269	SECOND	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0.88093	positive
1270	SECOND	Look, I respect his children.	0.533526	positive
1271	SECOND	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	0	neutral
1272	SECOND	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	0.46781	positive
1273	SECOND	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	0.748584	positive
1274	SECOND	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	0.753398	positive
1275	SECOND	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0	neutral
1276	SECOND	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	0.696611	positive
1277	SECOND	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	0	neutral
1278	SECOND	And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.	-0.431097	negative
1279	SECOND	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	0	neutral
1280	SECOND	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	0	neutral
1281	SECOND	Mr. Trump?	0	neutral
1282	SECOND	Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.	0.932845	positive
1283	SECOND	I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.	0.925502	positive
1284	SECOND	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	0.968663	positive
1285	SECOND	So I consider that a compliment.	0.85021	positive
1286	SECOND	I will say this about Hillary.	0	neutral
1287	SECOND	She doesn't quit.	-0.303719	negative
1288	SECOND	She doesn't give up.	-0.441195	negative
1289	SECOND	I respect that.	0.678348	positive
1290	SECOND	I tell it like it is.	0	neutral
1291	SECOND	She's a fighter.	0	neutral
1292	SECOND	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.	-0.70123	negative
1293	SECOND	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	-0.689791	negative
1294	SECOND	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	-0.617796	negative
1295	SECOND	And I consider that to be a very good trait.	0.524585	positive
1296	SECOND	Thanks to both of you.	0.796226	positive
1297	SECOND	We want to thank both the candidates.	0.743888	positive
1298	SECOND	We want to thank the university here.	0.534979	positive
1299	SECOND	This concludes the town hall meeting.	0	neutral
1300	SECOND	Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.	0.778162	positive
1301	SECOND	Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0	neutral
1302	SECOND	Good night, everyone.	0.624645	positive
0	THIRD	Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0	neutral
1	THIRD	I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.	0	neutral
2	THIRD	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0	neutral
3	THIRD	The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.	0	neutral
4	THIRD	Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.	0	neutral
5	THIRD	For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.	0	neutral
6	THIRD	None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.	-0.513224	negative
7	THIRD	The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.	0	neutral
8	THIRD	No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.	-0.491789	negative
9	THIRD	No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.	0	neutral
10	THIRD	(APPLAUSE)	0	neutral
11	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.	0.66455	positive
12	THIRD	Let's get right to it.	0	neutral
13	THIRD	The first topic is the Supreme Court.	0	neutral
14	THIRD	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.	-0.691524	negative
15	THIRD	Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.	0	neutral
16	THIRD	First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?	0	neutral
17	THIRD	And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?	0	neutral
18	THIRD	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?	0.477775	positive
19	THIRD	In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.	0	neutral
20	THIRD	You have two minutes.	0	neutral
21	THIRD	Thank you very much, Chris.	0.625992	positive
22	THIRD	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	0.779508	positive
23	THIRD	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0.567	positive
24	THIRD	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	0.750027	positive
25	THIRD	What kind of rights will Americans have?	-0.331372	negative
26	THIRD	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	0.830473	positive
27	THIRD	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	-0.794319	negative
28	THIRD	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	-0.743261	negative
29	THIRD	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	0	neutral
30	THIRD	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	0.859526	positive
31	THIRD	And I look forward to having that opportunity.	0.790543	positive
32	THIRD	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	0	neutral
33	THIRD	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	0	neutral
34	THIRD	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	0	neutral
35	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0.559889	positive
36	THIRD	Mr. Trump, same question.	0	neutral
37	THIRD	Where do you want to see the court take the country?	-0.39107	negative
38	THIRD	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?	0	neutral
39	THIRD	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	0.943702	positive
40	THIRD	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	0.45543	positive
41	THIRD	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	0	neutral
42	THIRD	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	-0.651603	negative
43	THIRD	And she was forced to apologize.	0	neutral
44	THIRD	And apologize she did.	0	neutral
45	THIRD	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	-0.391949	negative
46	THIRD	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	0	neutral
47	THIRD	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	0.504927	positive
48	THIRD	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	0.543672	positive
49	THIRD	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	-0.343837	negative
50	THIRD	They will have a conservative bent.	0	neutral
51	THIRD	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	0	neutral
52	THIRD	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	0.844973	positive
53	THIRD	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	0	neutral
54	THIRD	And I believe that's very, very important.	0.781493	positive
55	THIRD	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	-0.377783	negative
56	THIRD	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	0	neutral
57	THIRD	And those are the people that I will appoint.	0	neutral
58	THIRD	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0.796023	positive
59	THIRD	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.	0	neutral
60	THIRD	I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.	-0.32996	negative
61	THIRD	First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.	0	neutral
62	THIRD	"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."""	-0.299251	negative
63	THIRD	And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.	0.621614	positive
64	THIRD	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.	0	neutral
65	THIRD	What's wrong with that?	-0.706766	negative
66	THIRD	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	0.698793	positive
67	THIRD	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	0.770469	positive
68	THIRD	I represented upstate New York.	0	neutral
69	THIRD	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	0.518363	positive
70	THIRD	It goes back to the founding of our country.	0	neutral
71	THIRD	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0.435451	positive
72	THIRD	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	-0.642909	negative
73	THIRD	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	-0.317526	negative
74	THIRD	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	-0.410176	negative
75	THIRD	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0.444576	positive
76	THIRD	You mentioned the Heller decision.	0	neutral
77	THIRD	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	-0.655075	negative
78	THIRD	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	0	neutral
79	THIRD	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	0	neutral
80	THIRD	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.	0	neutral
81	THIRD	The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.	0	neutral
82	THIRD	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?	0.508483	positive
83	THIRD	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.	0	neutral
84	THIRD	Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?	0	neutral
85	THIRD	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	0.446638	positive
86	THIRD	I watched.	0	neutral
87	THIRD	I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.	-0.552701	negative
88	THIRD	And Justice Scalia was so involved.	0	neutral
89	THIRD	And it was a well-crafted decision.	0.648858	positive
90	THIRD	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.	-0.849664	negative
91	THIRD	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.	-0.699962	negative
92	THIRD	Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.	0	neutral
93	THIRD	Were you extremely upset?	-0.806619	negative
94	THIRD	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	-0.971964	negative
95	THIRD	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	0	neutral
96	THIRD	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	0	neutral
97	THIRD	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	0	neutral
98	THIRD	The gun lobby's on his side.	0	neutral
99	THIRD	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	-0.454012	negative
100	THIRD	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	0	neutral
101	THIRD	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	-0.465672	negative
102	THIRD	Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.	-0.566455	negative
103	THIRD	You support a national right to carry law.	0.578681	positive
104	THIRD	Why, sir?	-0.380321	negative
105	THIRD	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	0	neutral
106	THIRD	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	-0.429385	negative
107	THIRD	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	0	neutral
108	THIRD	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	0.659456	positive
109	THIRD	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0.841887	positive
110	THIRD	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	0	neutral
111	THIRD	So I'm very honored by all of that.	0.754588	positive
112	THIRD	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	0.755454	positive
113	THIRD	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	0	neutral
114	THIRD	Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.	0	neutral
115	THIRD	Right.	0.579146	positive
116	THIRD	Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.	0	neutral
117	THIRD	But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?	0	neutral
118	THIRD	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	0	neutral
119	THIRD	But I'm asking you specifically.	0	neutral
120	THIRD	Would you like to...	0	neutral
121	THIRD	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	-0.404506	negative
122	THIRD	But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.	0	neutral
123	THIRD	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?	-0.40755	negative
124	THIRD	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	0	neutral
125	THIRD	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	-0.394103	negative
126	THIRD	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	0	neutral
127	THIRD	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
128	THIRD	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	0.683246	positive
129	THIRD	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0	neutral
130	THIRD	It is about what's happening right now in America.	0.634087	positive
131	THIRD	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	-0.722988	negative
132	THIRD	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	0	neutral
133	THIRD	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	-0.688717	negative
134	THIRD	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	-0.616376	negative
135	THIRD	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	0	neutral
136	THIRD	Secretary Clinton…	0	neutral
137	THIRD	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.	0	neutral
138	THIRD	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.	-0.776771	negative
139	THIRD	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.	-0.364394	negative
140	THIRD	I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.	0	neutral
141	THIRD	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.	0	neutral
142	THIRD	You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.	-0.831378	negative
143	THIRD	Why?	-0.611646	negative
144	THIRD	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	0.554029	positive
145	THIRD	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	0	neutral
146	THIRD	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	-0.644062	negative
147	THIRD	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	-0.843607	negative
148	THIRD	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	0	neutral
149	THIRD	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	0.76633	positive
150	THIRD	Mr. Trump, your reaction?	0	neutral
151	THIRD	And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.	-0.893176	negative
152	THIRD	Well, I think it's terrible.	-0.736081	negative
153	THIRD	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	-0.640753	negative
154	THIRD	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	0	neutral
155	THIRD	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	-0.774536	negative
156	THIRD	And that's not acceptable.	-0.326571	negative
157	THIRD	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	0	neutral
158	THIRD	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	-0.898381	negative
159	THIRD	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	0	neutral
160	THIRD	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	-0.770297	negative
161	THIRD	And I do not believe the government should be making it.	-0.396186	negative
162	THIRD	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	0.736336	positive
163	THIRD	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	-0.336084	negative
164	THIRD	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	0	neutral
165	THIRD	And I will stand up for that right.	0.759666	positive
166	THIRD	All right.	0.526333	positive
167	THIRD	But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...	-0.537763	negative
168	THIRD	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	0	neutral
169	THIRD	Nobody has that.	-0.515245	negative
170	THIRD	All right.	0.526333	positive
171	THIRD	Let's move on to the subject of immigration.	0	neutral
172	THIRD	And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.	-0.347228	negative
173	THIRD	Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.	0	neutral
174	THIRD	Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.	0.552384	positive
175	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.	0	neutral
176	THIRD	Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.	0	neutral
177	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.	0.632171	positive
178	THIRD	The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?	-0.396369	negative
179	THIRD	Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.	0	neutral
180	THIRD	You have two minutes.	0	neutral
181	THIRD	Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.	-0.730808	negative
182	THIRD	We need strong borders.	0	neutral
183	THIRD	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	-0.654872	negative
184	THIRD	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	-0.354903	negative
185	THIRD	They're coming in illegally.	-0.407973	negative
186	THIRD	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	-0.551542	negative
187	THIRD	We have no country if we have no border.	-0.31708	negative
188	THIRD	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	-0.350286	negative
189	THIRD	She wants to have open borders.	-0.510161	negative
190	THIRD	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	0	neutral
191	THIRD	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	0.477638	positive
192	THIRD	It means their job is tougher.	0	neutral
193	THIRD	But they know what's going on.	0	neutral
194	THIRD	They know it better than anybody.	0	neutral
195	THIRD	They want strong borders.	0	neutral
196	THIRD	They feel we have to have strong borders.	0	neutral
197	THIRD	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	0	neutral
198	THIRD	The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.	-0.805186	negative
199	THIRD	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.	-0.590568	negative
200	THIRD	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	-0.519744	negative
201	THIRD	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	-0.507745	negative
202	THIRD	We have to have strong borders.	0	neutral
203	THIRD	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	-0.373118	negative
204	THIRD	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	0.561203	positive
205	THIRD	We need strong borders.	0	neutral
206	THIRD	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0	neutral
207	THIRD	Now, I want to build the wall.	0	neutral
208	THIRD	We need the wall.	0	neutral
209	THIRD	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.	0	neutral
210	THIRD	We stop the drugs.	-0.350255	negative
211	THIRD	We shore up the border.	0	neutral
212	THIRD	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	-0.845396	negative
213	THIRD	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.	0.804646	positive
214	THIRD	And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.	0.522849	positive
215	THIRD	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	-0.542116	negative
216	THIRD	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0.796023	positive
217	THIRD	Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.	0	neutral
218	THIRD	Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?	-0.767481	negative
219	THIRD	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	0	neutral
220	THIRD	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	0	neutral
221	THIRD	And you're right.	0.637341	positive
222	THIRD	I don't want to rip families apart.	-0.789506	negative
223	THIRD	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	-0.469711	negative
224	THIRD	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	-0.511937	negative
225	THIRD	We have 11 million undocumented people.	-0.375166	negative
226	THIRD	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	0	neutral
227	THIRD	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	-0.483661	negative
228	THIRD	Now, here's what that means.	0	neutral
229	THIRD	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	-0.674778	negative
230	THIRD	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	0	neutral
231	THIRD	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	0	neutral
232	THIRD	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	-0.804435	negative
233	THIRD	I have been for border security for years.	-0.438673	negative
234	THIRD	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	0	neutral
235	THIRD	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	0.458695	positive
236	THIRD	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	-0.654784	negative
237	THIRD	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	-0.46434	negative
238	THIRD	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	0	neutral
239	THIRD	Didn't even raise it.	-0.604613	negative
240	THIRD	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	-0.607737	negative
241	THIRD	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	0.695662	positive
242	THIRD	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	0	neutral
243	THIRD	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0.543778	positive
244	THIRD	I want to follow up...	-0.533554	negative
245	THIRD	Chris, I think it's...	0	neutral
246	THIRD	OK.	0	neutral
247	THIRD	I think I should respond to that.	0	neutral
248	THIRD	First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.	0.505769	positive
249	THIRD	Very nice man.	0.73551	positive
250	THIRD	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	0.708336	positive
251	THIRD	Believe me.	0	neutral
252	THIRD	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	-0.714084	negative
253	THIRD	It's a disaster.	-0.763021	negative
254	THIRD	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	-0.441959	negative
255	THIRD	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	0	neutral
256	THIRD	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	0	neutral
257	THIRD	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	-0.481556	negative
258	THIRD	Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...	0	neutral
259	THIRD	We are a country of laws.	0	neutral
260	THIRD	We either have -- and by the way...	0	neutral
261	THIRD	Now, wait.	0	neutral
262	THIRD	I'd like to hear from...	0	neutral
263	THIRD	Well -- well, but she said one thing.	0	neutral
264	THIRD	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.	0	neutral
265	THIRD	I voted for border security, and there are...	0	neutral
266	THIRD	And the wall.	0	neutral
267	THIRD	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	0	neutral
268	THIRD	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	0.789177	positive
269	THIRD	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	0	neutral
270	THIRD	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	-0.786632	negative
271	THIRD	And Donald knows a lot about this.	0	neutral
272	THIRD	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	0	neutral
273	THIRD	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	-0.544278	negative
274	THIRD	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	-0.94423	negative
275	THIRD	Mr. Trump?	0	neutral
276	THIRD	President Obama has moved millions of people out.	-0.459584	negative
277	THIRD	Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.	-0.61327	negative
278	THIRD	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	-0.516339	negative
279	THIRD	They've been deported.	0	neutral
280	THIRD	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	-0.611424	negative
281	THIRD	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.	0	neutral
282	THIRD	We're a country of laws.	0	neutral
283	THIRD	We either have a border or we don't.	-0.337358	negative
284	THIRD	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.	0.457679	positive
285	THIRD	But it's very unfair.	-0.869935	negative
286	THIRD	We have millions of people that did it the right way.	0	neutral
287	THIRD	They're on line.	0	neutral
288	THIRD	They're waiting.	0	neutral
289	THIRD	We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.	-0.787173	negative
290	THIRD	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	-0.293778	negative
291	THIRD	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	-0.742257	negative
292	THIRD	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	-0.682333	negative
293	THIRD	I want to...	-0.497193	negative
294	THIRD	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	-0.473002	negative
295	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, I want to...	-0.498107	negative
296	THIRD	We will not have open borders.	0	neutral
297	THIRD	That is...	0	neutral
298	THIRD	Well, let me -- Secretary...	0	neutral
299	THIRD	That is a rank mischaracterization.	-0.583088	negative
300	THIRD	Secretary Clinton...	-0.395276	negative
301	THIRD	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.	0	neutral
302	THIRD	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	0	neutral
303	THIRD	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	-0.498576	negative
304	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, excuse me.	-0.44085	negative
305	THIRD	Secretary Clinton.	0	neutral
306	THIRD	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	0	neutral
307	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.	0	neutral
308	THIRD	My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.	0	neutral
309	THIRD	So that's the question...	0	neutral
310	THIRD	Thank you.	0.75598	positive
311	THIRD	That's the question.	0	neutral
312	THIRD	Please quiet, everybody.	0	neutral
313	THIRD	Is that your dream, open borders?	0	neutral
314	THIRD	Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.	0	neutral
315	THIRD	You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.	0	neutral
316	THIRD	And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.	0	neutral
317	THIRD	I think that would be a great benefit to us.	0.821618	positive
318	THIRD	But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.	-0.350101	negative
319	THIRD	And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.	0.431661	positive
320	THIRD	They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.	0	neutral
321	THIRD	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.	-0.483867	negative
322	THIRD	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.	0	neutral
323	THIRD	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	0	neutral
324	THIRD	Those are the questions we need answered.	0	neutral
325	THIRD	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	-0.487491	negative
326	THIRD	Well?	0	neutral
327	THIRD	That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?	0	neutral
328	THIRD	How did we get on to Putin?	-0.366897	negative
329	THIRD	Hold on -- hold on, wait.	0	neutral
330	THIRD	Hold on, folks.	0	neutral
331	THIRD	Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.	0.436737	positive
332	THIRD	Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.	0.642598	positive
333	THIRD	So just to finish on the borders...	-0.320377	negative
334	THIRD	Yes?	0	neutral
335	THIRD	She wants open borders.	-0.423095	negative
336	THIRD	People are going to pour into our country.	0	neutral
337	THIRD	People are going to come in from Syria.	0	neutral
338	THIRD	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.	-0.541826	negative
339	THIRD	They have no idea where they come from.	-0.401725	negative
340	THIRD	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	-0.449537	negative
341	THIRD	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	-0.755864	negative
342	THIRD	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	-0.432715	negative
343	THIRD	Now we can talk about Putin.	0	neutral
344	THIRD	I don't know Putin.	0	neutral
345	THIRD	He said nice things about me.	0	neutral
346	THIRD	If we got along well, that would be good.	0.678291	positive
347	THIRD	If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.	0	neutral
348	THIRD	He has no respect for her.	-0.324483	negative
349	THIRD	He has no respect for our president.	-0.37838	negative
350	THIRD	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	-0.331579	negative
351	THIRD	And she's playing chicken.	0	neutral
352	THIRD	Look, Putin...	0	neutral
353	THIRD	Wait, but...	0	neutral
354	THIRD	... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	0	neutral
355	THIRD	Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.	0	neutral
356	THIRD	No puppet.	0	neutral
357	THIRD	No puppet.	0	neutral
358	THIRD	And it's pretty clear...	0.729348	positive

425	THIRD	But here's the deal.	0.653352	positive
426	THIRD	The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.	0	neutral
427	THIRD	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	-0.373105	negative

461	THIRD	Yes.	0	neutral
462	THIRD	We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.	-0.708727	negative

464	THIRD	In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.	0	neutral
465	THIRD	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	0.857359	positive
466	THIRD	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	-0.31238	negative
467	THIRD	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	0	neutral
468	THIRD	I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.	0	neutral
469	THIRD	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	0.568666	positive

471	THIRD	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	0	neutral
472	THIRD	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	-0.886694	negative
473	THIRD	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0	neutral
474	THIRD	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	0.647002	positive
475	THIRD	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	0	neutral
476	THIRD	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	-0.410453	negative
477	THIRD	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	0	neutral
478	THIRD	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	0	neutral
479	THIRD	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	0.80192	positive
480	THIRD	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.	0.774567	positive
481	THIRD	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	0.484473	positive
482	THIRD	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	-0.38949	negative
483	THIRD	Why?	-0.611646	negative
484	THIRD	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	-0.809997	negative
485	THIRD	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	0.513888	positive
486	THIRD	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.	0	neutral
487	THIRD	Secretary, thank you.	0.62536	positive
488	THIRD	Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?	0	neutral
489	THIRD	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.	-0.297009	negative
490	THIRD	Her tax plan is a disaster.	-0.686128	negative
491	THIRD	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.	-0.314264	negative
492	THIRD	And I'm a big proponent.	0	neutral
493	THIRD	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.	0.466013	positive
494	THIRD	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.	-0.450862	negative
495	THIRD	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	-0.753163	negative
496	THIRD	But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.	0.790386	positive

503	THIRD	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.	-0.712303	negative

510	THIRD	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	0.827705	positive
511	THIRD	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	0	neutral
512	THIRD	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0.666153	positive
513	THIRD	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	-0.447311	negative

517	THIRD	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	0.722118	positive

540	THIRD	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	-0.776851	negative
541	THIRD	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	-0.597215	negative
542	THIRD	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	-0.432395	negative

549	THIRD	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.	-0.445353	negative
550	THIRD	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	0.724858	positive
551	THIRD	So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.	0.917024	positive
552	THIRD	That's the kind of approach that will work.	0.499291	positive

555	THIRD	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.	-0.339054	negative

557	THIRD	Correct.	0.570791	positive
558	THIRD	Thank you, sir.	0.726431	positive
559	THIRD	You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.	-0.587064	negative
560	THIRD	So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?	0	neutral
561	THIRD	Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0.522211	positive

568	THIRD	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0	neutral
569	THIRD	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0	neutral
570	THIRD	That is not going to work.	-0.607466	negative
571	THIRD	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.	0.700455	positive
572	THIRD	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	0	neutral

759	THIRD	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
760	THIRD	Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.	-0.500285	negative
761	THIRD	And it's not just about women.	-0.325966	negative
762	THIRD	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.	-0.683028	negative
763	THIRD	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	0	neutral

771	THIRD	That is not who America is.	-0.350195	negative
772	THIRD	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0	neutral

864	THIRD	I want to get into one...	-0.481036	negative
865	THIRD	But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.	0	neutral
866	THIRD	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.	0	neutral
867	THIRD	You can look at our tax returns.	0	neutral
868	THIRD	We've got them all out there.	0	neutral

871	THIRD	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	-0.483213	negative

908	THIRD	First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.	-0.610793	negative
909	THIRD	The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.	-0.412404	negative
910	THIRD	It's so dishonest.	-0.8741	negative
911	THIRD	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.	-0.489072	negative
912	THIRD	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.	-0.769536	negative
913	THIRD	I think they're going to see through it.	0.494003	positive
914	THIRD	We'll find out on November 8th.	0	neutral

924	THIRD	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	-0.698902	negative
925	THIRD	But...	0	neutral
926	THIRD	Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.	-0.316751	negative
927	THIRD	But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.	0.614507	positive
928	THIRD	Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.	-0.352576	negative
929	THIRD	Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?	-0.61151	negative
930	THIRD	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	0	neutral

942	THIRD	Should have gotten it.	0	neutral
943	THIRD	(LAUGHTER)	0	neutral
944	THIRD	This is -- this is a mindset.	0.799791	positive
945	THIRD	This is how Donald thinks.	0	neutral
946	THIRD	And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.	-0.793489	negative
947	THIRD	OK.	0	neutral

959	THIRD	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	0.537236	positive
960	THIRD	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	-0.561558	negative
961	THIRD	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	-0.379031	negative
962	THIRD	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	-0.801938	negative
963	THIRD	I think it's a disgrace.	-0.624421	negative
964	THIRD	All right.	0.526333	positive

969	THIRD	Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.	0	neutral
970	THIRD	The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.	-0.479118	negative
971	THIRD	If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?	-0.465067	negative
972	THIRD	And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.	-0.613956	negative
973	THIRD	Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?	-0.785204	negative
974	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.	0	neutral
975	THIRD	You have two minutes.	0	neutral
976	THIRD	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	0.495983	positive
977	THIRD	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.	0	neutral
978	THIRD	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	0	neutral
979	THIRD	In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.	0	neutral
980	THIRD	The goal here is to take back Mosul.	0	neutral
981	THIRD	It's going to be a hard fight.	0	neutral
982	THIRD	I've got no illusions about that.	-0.521896	negative
983	THIRD	And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.	0	neutral
984	THIRD	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	0.910334	positive
985	THIRD	But we know we've got lots of work to do.	-0.299549	negative
986	THIRD	Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.	-0.613876	negative
987	THIRD	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	0	neutral
988	THIRD	That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.	-0.797412	negative
989	THIRD	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.	-0.570011	negative
990	THIRD	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0	neutral
991	THIRD	Mr. Trump, same question.	0	neutral
992	THIRD	If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?	-0.580656	negative
993	THIRD	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	-0.859734	negative
994	THIRD	We had Mosul.	0	neutral
995	THIRD	But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.	-0.469767	negative
996	THIRD	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	-0.464656	negative
997	THIRD	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.	-0.380236	negative
998	THIRD	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.	0	neutral
999	THIRD	Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?	0	neutral
1000	THIRD	We announce we're going after Mosul.	0	neutral

1005	THIRD	Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.	-0.708578	negative
1006	THIRD	So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.	-0.390939	negative
1007	THIRD	All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.	0	neutral
1008	THIRD	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	0	neutral
1009	THIRD	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0	neutral
1010	THIRD	They want to look good.	0	neutral
1011	THIRD	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	-0.898089	negative
1012	THIRD	That's why we have the great migration.	0	neutral
1013	THIRD	But she wanted to look good for the election.	0	neutral
1014	THIRD	So they're going in.	0	neutral
1015	THIRD	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	0	neutral
1016	THIRD	We'll take Mosul eventually.	0	neutral
1017	THIRD	But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.	0	neutral
1018	THIRD	Much, much tougher.	0	neutral
1019	THIRD	Much more dangerous.	-0.677588	negative
1020	THIRD	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	-0.54746	negative
1021	THIRD	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	0	neutral
1022	THIRD	They say, what do we need this for?	0	neutral
1023	THIRD	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	0.734682	positive
1024	THIRD	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	-0.742609	negative
1025	THIRD	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	0	neutral
1026	THIRD	So we're now going to take Mosul.	0	neutral
1027	THIRD	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	0	neutral
1028	THIRD	Iran.	-0.541934	negative
1029	THIRD	Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.	-0.315665	negative
1030	THIRD	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.	-0.443011	negative
1031	THIRD	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	0	neutral

1033	THIRD	Sir, your two minutes are up.	0	neutral
1034	THIRD	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	-0.479811	negative
1035	THIRD	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	0	neutral
1036	THIRD	I said it was a mistake.	-0.788386	negative

1046	THIRD	Wrong.	-0.660069	negative
1047	THIRD	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	0	neutral
1048	THIRD	Now, why does that matter?	-0.342059	negative
1049	THIRD	Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.	0	neutral
1050	THIRD	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	0.435031	positive
1051	THIRD	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0.815832	positive
1052	THIRD	Mosul is a Sunni city.	-0.413279	negative

1062	THIRD	This is what we have to do.	0	neutral
1063	THIRD	I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.	0	neutral

1121	THIRD	Would you like to clear that up, sir?	0.582785	positive
1122	THIRD	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	-0.563576	negative
1123	THIRD	It's a humanitarian nightmare.	0	neutral
1124	THIRD	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	-0.71956	negative
1125	THIRD	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	-0.312114	negative
1126	THIRD	Take a look at Aleppo.	0	neutral
1127	THIRD	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	-0.87541	negative
1128	THIRD	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	0.486213	positive
1129	THIRD	And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.	0	neutral
1130	THIRD	He -- he aligned with Russia.	0	neutral
1131	THIRD	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	0.615844	positive
1132	THIRD	We gave them $150 billion back.	0	neutral
1133	THIRD	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.	0	neutral
1134	THIRD	I mean, cash.	-0.545784	negative
1135	THIRD	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.	0	neutral
1136	THIRD	We gave them $1.7 billion.	0	neutral
1137	THIRD	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.	0	neutral
1138	THIRD	They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.	0	neutral
1139	THIRD	We don't know who the rebels are.	0	neutral
1140	THIRD	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	0.711871	positive
1141	THIRD	We don't know who the rebels are.	0	neutral
1142	THIRD	And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.	-0.396334	negative
1143	THIRD	But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.	-0.812891	negative
1144	THIRD	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.	0	neutral
1145	THIRD	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	-0.480654	negative
1146	THIRD	Let me...	0	neutral
1147	THIRD	... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.	0.472535	positive
1148	THIRD	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	0	neutral
1149	THIRD	Lots of luck, Hillary.	0.495023	positive
1150	THIRD	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	0.916604	positive
1151	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.	-0.710272	negative
1152	THIRD	President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.	-0.696796	negative
1153	THIRD	And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia.	0	neutral
1154	THIRD	So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?	-0.682421	negative
1155	THIRD	Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?	-0.69676	negative
1156	THIRD	Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.	-0.643458	negative
1157	THIRD	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	0.746927	positive
1158	THIRD	This would not be done just on the first day.	0	neutral
1159	THIRD	This would take a lot of negotiation.	0	neutral
1160	THIRD	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.	0	neutral
1161	THIRD	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	-0.655227	negative
1162	THIRD	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	0	neutral
1163	THIRD	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	-0.459364	negative
1164	THIRD	He's made these claims repeatedly.	0	neutral
1165	THIRD	I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.	-0.712339	negative
1166	THIRD	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	-0.664165	negative
1167	THIRD	That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.	0	neutral
1168	THIRD	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	0.859965	positive
1169	THIRD	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	-0.698418	negative
1170	THIRD	In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.	0	neutral
1171	THIRD	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.	0.832139	positive
1172	THIRD	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.	0	neutral
1173	THIRD	Folks, I want to get into our final segment.	-0.309395	negative
1174	THIRD	But I just have to...	-0.494852	negative
1175	THIRD	Real quick.	0.769699	positive
1176	THIRD	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.	-0.620416	negative
1177	THIRD	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	0	neutral
1178	THIRD	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	0	neutral
1179	THIRD	OK.	0	neutral
1180	THIRD	We should have -- wait one second.	0	neutral
1181	THIRD	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.	0	neutral
1182	THIRD	A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.	0	neutral
1183	THIRD	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	0	neutral
1184	THIRD	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	-0.359591	negative
1185	THIRD	They are outplayed.	-0.314084	negative
1186	THIRD	Now, she wasn't there.	0	neutral
1187	THIRD	I assume she had nothing to do with it.	-0.552149	negative
1188	THIRD	But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.	-0.677577	negative
1189	THIRD	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.	-0.711092	negative
1190	THIRD	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.	-0.361712	negative
1191	THIRD	Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.	-0.295719	negative
1192	THIRD	That's the highest since just after World War II.	0	neutral
1193	THIRD	But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.	-0.662633	negative
1194	THIRD	Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.	-0.439544	negative
1195	THIRD	The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?	-0.789156	negative
1196	THIRD	Mr. Trump, you go first.	0	neutral
1197	THIRD	Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.	-0.608259	negative
1198	THIRD	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	0	neutral
1199	THIRD	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	0	neutral
1200	THIRD	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0.682769	positive
1201	THIRD	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0	neutral
1202	THIRD	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	0	neutral
1203	THIRD	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.	0	neutral
1204	THIRD	To do that, we're taking back jobs.	0	neutral
1205	THIRD	We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.	-0.91823	negative
1206	THIRD	It's very sad.	-0.899362	negative
1207	THIRD	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.	0.813127	positive
1208	THIRD	We used to be there.	0	neutral
1209	THIRD	We've given it up.	0	neutral
1210	THIRD	We've become very, very sloppy.	-0.817713	negative
1211	THIRD	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	-0.550373	negative
1212	THIRD	You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.	0	neutral
1213	THIRD	But we don't use those people.	0	neutral
1214	THIRD	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.	0	neutral
1215	THIRD	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	0	neutral
1216	THIRD	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	0	neutral
1217	THIRD	We use political hacks.	0	neutral
1218	THIRD	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.	0.702021	positive
1219	THIRD	So we have to use our great people.	0.522609	positive
1220	THIRD	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	0	neutral
1221	THIRD	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	-0.433573	negative
1222	THIRD	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.	0.687225	positive
1223	THIRD	Secretary Clinton?	-0.357956	negative
1224	THIRD	"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."	0.774024	positive
1225	THIRD	"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."	0	neutral
1226	THIRD	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	-0.338927	negative
1227	THIRD	He was criticizing President Reagan.	0	neutral
1228	THIRD	"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."	0	neutral
1229	THIRD	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	0	neutral
1230	THIRD	I do not add a penny to the national debt.	-0.489879	negative
1231	THIRD	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	0	neutral
1232	THIRD	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	0.823486	positive
1233	THIRD	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0.797764	positive
1234	THIRD	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	-0.798939	negative
1235	THIRD	In fact, I think just the opposite.	0	neutral
1236	THIRD	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	0	neutral
1237	THIRD	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	0.434139	positive
1238	THIRD	That's where growth will come from.	0	neutral
1239	THIRD	That's why I want to invest in you.	-0.418357	negative
1240	THIRD	I want to invest in your family.	0	neutral
1241	THIRD	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	0.87933	positive
1242	THIRD	And we just have a big disagreement about this.	-0.513442	negative
1243	THIRD	It may be because of our experiences.	0	neutral
1244	THIRD	You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...	0	neutral
1245	THIRD	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	0	neutral
1246	THIRD	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.	0	neutral
1247	THIRD	We've heard this before.	0	neutral
1248	THIRD	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	0.621445	positive
1249	THIRD	Time.	0	neutral
1250	THIRD	Thank you, Hillary.	0.657361	positive
1251	THIRD	Could I just respond?	-0.325856	negative
1252	THIRD	Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...	0	neutral
1253	THIRD	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.	0	neutral
1254	THIRD	I disagreed with him.	-0.346992	negative
1255	THIRD	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.	0	neutral
1256	THIRD	I've been waiting for years.	0	neutral
1257	THIRD	Nobody does it right.	0	neutral
1258	THIRD	OK.	0	neutral
1259	THIRD	And frankly, now we're going to do it right.	0	neutral
1260	THIRD	All right.	0.526333	positive
1261	THIRD	The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.	-0.705927	negative
1262	THIRD	Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.	0	neutral
1263	THIRD	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?	0.848578	positive
1264	THIRD	I'm cutting taxes.	-0.729698	negative
1265	THIRD	We're going to grow the economy.	0.531796	positive
1266	THIRD	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0.695185	positive
1267	THIRD	That's not going to help in the entitlements.	-0.623379	negative
1268	THIRD	No, it's going to totally help you.	0	neutral
1269	THIRD	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	-0.65784	negative
1270	THIRD	It's destroying our country.	-0.504035	negative
1271	THIRD	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	-0.373249	negative
1272	THIRD	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	-0.77568	negative
1273	THIRD	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	-0.347852	negative
1274	THIRD	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	-0.741764	negative
1275	THIRD	But Obamacare has to go.	-0.744337	negative
1276	THIRD	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	-0.419362	negative
1277	THIRD	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	0	neutral
1278	THIRD	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	-0.895457	negative
1279	THIRD	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	-0.700477	negative
1280	THIRD	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	-0.77568	negative
1281	THIRD	And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.	0.487271	positive
1282	THIRD	Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?	0.873562	positive
1283	THIRD	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	0	neutral
1284	THIRD	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	0.464993	positive
1285	THIRD	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	-0.384599	negative
1286	THIRD	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	0	neutral
1287	THIRD	Such a nasty woman.	-0.833495	negative
1288	THIRD	... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	0.561616	positive
1289	THIRD	I will not cut benefits.	0	neutral
1290	THIRD	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	0	neutral
1291	THIRD	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	-0.717347	negative
1292	THIRD	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	-0.659367	negative
1293	THIRD	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	0.435108	positive
1294	THIRD	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	0.888607	positive
1295	THIRD	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	-0.781575	negative
1296	THIRD	What we need to do is go after...	0	neutral
1297	THIRD	Your husband disagrees with you.	0	neutral
1298	THIRD	... the long-term health care drivers.	0.646682	positive
1299	THIRD	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	0.538087	positive
1300	THIRD	I have a plan for doing that.	0	neutral
1301	THIRD	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	-0.68182	negative
1302	THIRD	This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign.	0.801992	positive
1303	THIRD	I would like to end it on a positive note.	0.480941	positive
1304	THIRD	You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.	0.471644	positive
1305	THIRD	So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president.	0	neutral
1306	THIRD	This is another new mini-segment.	0	neutral
1307	THIRD	Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.	-0.369985	negative
1308	THIRD	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0	neutral
1309	THIRD	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	0.780895	positive
1310	THIRD	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.	0	neutral
1311	THIRD	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	0.954453	positive
1312	THIRD	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	-0.663138	negative
1313	THIRD	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.	0	neutral
1314	THIRD	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	0	neutral

166	NinthDem	A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.	0.0	neutral
167	NinthDem	What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.	-0.845846	negative
168	NinthDem	Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.	0.0	neutral
169	NinthDem	Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.	-0.865362	negative
170	NinthDem	But, Senator...	0.0	neutral
171	NinthDem	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.	0.720268	positive
172	NinthDem	But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?	-0.627735	negative
173	NinthDem	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.	-0.837095	negative
174	NinthDem	You've got to be a certain size.	0.0	neutral
175	NinthDem	And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.	-0.700328	negative
176	NinthDem	I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.	0.0	neutral

181	NinthDem	Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.	0.852083	positive
182	NinthDem	Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.	0.0	neutral
183	NinthDem	That has to be the judgement of the regulators.	-0.654168	negative
184	NinthDem	But, there's another element to this.	0.0	neutral
185	NinthDem	I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.	0.586353	positive
186	NinthDem	(APPLAUSE)	0.458633	positive
187	NinthDem	They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.	-0.479728	negative
188	NinthDem	Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0.796104	positive

531	NinthDem	Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.	-0.462813	negative
532	NinthDem	They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.	-0.364692	negative
533	NinthDem	But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.	0.0	neutral
534	NinthDem	He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.	0.0	neutral

538	NinthDem	Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.	-0.299366	negative

541	NinthDem	Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.	0.0	neutral
542	NinthDem	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.	-0.861047	negative

545	NinthDem	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.	0.0	neutral
546	NinthDem	Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.	-0.623968	negative
547	NinthDem	But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.	0.0	neutral
548	NinthDem	They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.	-0.597029	negative

551	NinthDem	They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.	0.461106	positive
552	NinthDem	They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.	0.923268	positive
553	NinthDem	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.	0.948012	positive
554	NinthDem	This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.	-0.537632	negative
555	NinthDem	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.	-0.641928	negative

557	NinthDem	What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.	0.0	neutral

564	NinthDem	Thank you, Senator.	0.855849	positive
565	NinthDem	Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.	-0.37505	negative
566	NinthDem	Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.	0.0	neutral
567	NinthDem	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.	-0.559498	negative
568	NinthDem	Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?	-0.61771	negative

574	NinthDem	So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.	0.605301	positive
575	NinthDem	On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.	0.48271	positive
576	NinthDem	I think that sentences got much too long.	-0.861891	negative
577	NinthDem	The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.	-0.884565	negative
578	NinthDem	So we have a problem.	-0.662187	negative
579	NinthDem	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.	-0.641107	negative
580	NinthDem	So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.	0.513041	positive
581	NinthDem	So that's how I see it.	0.710706	positive
582	NinthDem	And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.	0.891609	positive

664	NinthDem	And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.	0.0	neutral
665	NinthDem	But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.	-0.733175	negative
666	NinthDem	And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.	0.535989	positive
667	NinthDem	"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge."	-0.782194	negative
668	NinthDem	So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.	0.0	neutral
669	NinthDem	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.	0.657937	positive
670	NinthDem	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.	0.737522	positive
671	NinthDem	And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.	0.622216	positive

679	NinthDem	That's true.	0.787857	positive
680	NinthDem	But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.	0.535766	positive

739	NinthDem	Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.	0.565278	positive
740	NinthDem	Why have you changed your view on fracking?	-0.748863	negative
741	NinthDem	No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.	0.583598	positive
742	NinthDem	And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.	0.580193	positive
743	NinthDem	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.	0.0	neutral
744	NinthDem	We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.	0.0	neutral

748	NinthDem	So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.	0.813359	positive

762	NinthDem	You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.	0.966965	positive
