3	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
4	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who would have believed that when we started this journey because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago.
5	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who would have believed this.
6	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who would have believed this.
7	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago.
8	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not so good.
9	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not so good.
10	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.
11	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will be a country of generosity and warmth.
12	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we will also be a country of law and order.
13	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.
14	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life.
15	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
16	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.
17	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.
18	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.
19	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored. 
20	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
21	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.
22	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.
23	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
24	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.
25	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.
26	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go there.
27	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.
28	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
29	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.
30	TRUMP	8	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities.
31	TRUMP	7	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	That's the largest increase in 25 years.
32	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.
33	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.
34	TRUMP	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone.
35	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	And more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.
36	TRUMP	6	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.
37	TRUMP	6	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.
38	TRUMP	7	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.
39	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.
40	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
41	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.
42	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.
43	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Number one in her class.
44	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.
45	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've met Sarah's beautiful family.
46	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting.
47	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No more.
48	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.
49	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What about our economy? 
50	TRUMP	6	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed.
51	TRUMP	6	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
52	TRUMP	4	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.
53	TRUMP	7	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.
54	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	That's sixteen years ago.
55	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	Our trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone.
56	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to fix that.
57	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The budget is no better.
58	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.
59	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And yet, what do we have to show for it? 
60	TRUMP	5	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.
61	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.
62	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another.
63	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One after another.
64	TRUMP	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.
65	TRUMP	7	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.
66	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.
67	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.
68	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.
69	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's defeat her in November, okay?
70	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets.
71	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today.
72	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's review the record.
73	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.
74	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Libya was stable.
75	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Egypt was peaceful.
76	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence.
77	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Iran was being choked by sanctions.
78	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Syria was somewhat under control.
79	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? 
80	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world.
81	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.
82	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.
83	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iraq is in chaos.
84	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.
85	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West.
86	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.
87	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.
88	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.
89	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.
90	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.
91	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America.
92	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.
93	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
94	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.
95	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The respect that we deserve.
96	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The American People will come first once again.
97	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism.
98	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There can be no prosperity without law and order.
99	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.
100	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.
101	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.
102	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
103	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's for their benefit.
104	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.
105	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does.
106	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.
107	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change.
108	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Never ever.
109	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.
110	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.
111	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.
112	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are the forgotten men and women of our country.
113	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they are forgotten.
114	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they're not going to be forgotten long.
115	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice.
116	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am your voice.
117	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
118	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have no patience for injustice.
119	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How great are our police! 
120	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how great is Cleveland?
121	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
122	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have no patience for injustice.
123	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.
124	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.
125	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I won't look the other way.
126	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.
127	TRUMP	3	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	"When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did."
128	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.
129	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly.
130	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.
131	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.
132	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody knows the system better than me.
133	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which is why I alone can fix it.
134	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.
135	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Never had a chance.
136	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.
137	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans.
138	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.
139	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And a great guy.
140	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.
141	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which is amazing.
142	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's a man of character and accomplishment.
143	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	He's the man for the job.
144	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community.
145	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed.
146	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.
147	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.
148	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
149	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured.
150	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.
151	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.
152	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
153	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
154	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.
155	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.
156	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.
157	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This Administration has failed America's inner cities.
158	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Remember, it has failed America's inner cities.
159	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's failed them on education.
160	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's failed them on jobs.
161	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's failed them on crime.
162	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's failed them in every way and at every single level.
163	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.
164	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? 
165	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Any other child.
166	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country.
167	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast.
168	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.
169	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Men, women and children viciously mowed down.
170	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lives ruined.
171	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Families ripped apart.
172	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A nation in mourning.
173	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
174	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And many many other locations.
175	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist.
176	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community.
177	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No good, and we're going to stop it.
178	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.
179	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
180	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.
181	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
182	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.
183	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world.
184	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The best.
185	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria.
186	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly.
187	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to win.
188	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to win fast.
189	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.
190	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Recently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror.
191	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share.
192	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs.
193	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism.
194	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A true step in the right direction.
195	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.
196	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't want them in our country.
197	TRUMP	8	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this.
198	TRUMP	6	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening.
199	TRUMP	8	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.
200	TRUMP	6	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.
201	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.
202	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.
203	TRUMP	3	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.
204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.
205	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw.
206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly.
207	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve.
208	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to solve it.
209	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These families have no special interests to represent them.
210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf.
211	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.
212	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
213	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.
214	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
215	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel? 
216	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly.
217	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? 
218	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These wounded American families have been alone.
219	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they are not alone any longer.
220	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.
221	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	<br>We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.
222	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.
223	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system.
224	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lawful.
225	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence.
226	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Illegal border crossings will go down.
227	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore.
228	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
229	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Peace will be restored.
230	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve.
231	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say.
232	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.
233	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.
234	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
235	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	USA.
236	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	USA.
237	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	USA.
238	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.
239	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.
240	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which is what we have now.
241	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Communities want relief.
242	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.
243	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.
244	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a different vision for our workers.
245	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.
246	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of which there are many.
247	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.
248	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again.
249	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.
250	TRUMP	5	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
251	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.
252	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Or frankly, any other country.
253	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Never ever again.
254	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence.
255	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not going to happen anymore.
256	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.
257	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.
258	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea.
259	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
260	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.
261	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's not going to happen.
262	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence.
263	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will never sign bad trade deals.
264	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America First again.
265	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America First.
266	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.
267	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.
268	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats.
269	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.
270	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are the greatest that ever came about.
271	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.
272	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated.
273	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal.
274	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our country is going to start building and making things again.
275	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.
276	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.
277	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone.
278	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean everyone.
279	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.
280	TRUMP	3	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.
281	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.
282	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all.
283	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly.
284	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
285	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.
286	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president.
287	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.
288	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	With these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.
289	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.
290	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs.
291	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.
292	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children.
293	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what she's doing.
294	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what's she's done.
295	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
296	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	You will be able to choose your own doctor again.
297	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we will fix TSA at the airports! 
298	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which is a total disaster.
299	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives.
300	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tremendous problem.
301	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.
302	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.
303	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support.
304	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying.
305	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	My opponent dismissed the VA scandal.
306	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One more sign of how out of touch she really is.
307	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
308	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.
309	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
310	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies.
311	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very important.
312	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.
313	TRUMP	3	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.
314	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.
315	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what.
316	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing.
317	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight.
318	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	True.
319	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So true.
320	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.
321	TRUMP	3	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.
322	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Their voice has been taken away.
323	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.
324	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.
325	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Start believing.
326	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.
327	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.
328	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job.
329	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew.
330	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight.
331	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.
332	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.
333	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I love those people.
334	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then there's my mother, Mary.
335	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded.
336	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was a truly great mother.
337	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character.
338	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She could pick 'em out from anywhere.
339	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.
340	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have had a truly great life in business.
341	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for you.
342	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.
