0	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.
1	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."""
2	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.
3	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
4	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.
5	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.
6	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.
7	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.
8	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.
9	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.
10	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.
11	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.
12	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
13	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
14	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How are you, Donald?
15	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
16	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good luck to you.
17	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
18	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.
19	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.
20	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.
21	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.
22	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, let's begin.
23	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."""
24	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And central to that is jobs.
25	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are two economic realities in America today.
26	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.
27	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
28	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?
29	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.
30	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
31	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.
32	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
33	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
34	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want us to invest in you.
35	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want us to invest in your future.
36	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.
37	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We also have to make the economy fairer.
38	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.
39	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.
40	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.
41	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.
42	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.
43	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.
44	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.
45	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How are we going to do it?
46	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.
47	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.
48	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.
49	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.
50	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.
51	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
52	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, the same question to you.
53	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.
54	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have up to two minutes.
55	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Lester.
56	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	Our jobs are fleeing the country.
57	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	They're going to Mexico.
58	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	They're going to many other countries.
59	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.
60	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.
61	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have a very good fight.
62	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have a winning fight.
63	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.
64	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.
65	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.
66	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.
67	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	With the United States, as he said, not so much.
68	TRUMP	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	So Ford is leaving.
69	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You see that, their small car division leaving.
70	TRUMP	5	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.
71	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're all leaving.
72	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.
73	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.
74	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.
75	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.
76	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.
77	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.
78	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They left -- fired 1,400 people.
79	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	They're going to Mexico.
80	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.
81	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot let it happen.
82	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.
83	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.
84	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
85	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Companies will come.
86	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They will build.
87	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They will expand.
88	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	New companies will start.
89	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I look very, very much forward to doing it.
90	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.
91	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?
92	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.
93	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.
94	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.
95	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.
96	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.
97	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.
98	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.
99	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not how we grow the economy.
100	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.
101	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.
102	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I understand that.
103	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.
104	CLINTON	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.
105	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't buy that.
106	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a different experience.
107	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My father was a small-businessman.
108	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He worked really hard.
109	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.
110	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.
111	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.
112	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.
113	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.
114	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?
115	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?
116	TRUMP	6	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
117	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our country's in deep trouble.
118	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.
119	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're the best, the best ever at it.
120	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.
121	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have to do that.
122	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.
123	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.
124	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me give you the example of Mexico.
125	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have a VAT tax.
126	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're on a different system.
127	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.
128	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.
129	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When they sell into us, there's no tax.
130	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a defective agreement.
131	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.
132	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?
133	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good.
134	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want you to be very happy.
135	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's very important to me.
136	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.
137	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's been doing this for 30 years.
138	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?
139	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The NAFTA agreement is defective.
140	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...
141	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me interrupt just a moment, but...
142	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.
143	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They should have been doing this for years.
144	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.
145	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.
146	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Back to the question, though.
147	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?
148	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you make them bring the jobs back?
149	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.
150	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The companies are leaving.
151	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.
152	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.
153	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.
154	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We wish you a lot of luck.
155	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.
156	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.
157	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.
158	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to stop them from leaving.
159	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's a big, big factor.
160	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.
161	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.
162	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.
163	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.
164	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.
165	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""
166	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it did collapse.
167	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's called business, by the way.
168	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.
169	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Five million people lost their homes.
170	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
171	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, we have come back from that abyss.
172	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it has not been easy.
173	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.
174	CLINTON	6	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.
175	CLINTON	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.
176	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take clean energy.
177	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.
178	CLINTON	6	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
179	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's real.
180	TRUMP	5	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	I did not.
181	TRUMP	5	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	I did not.
182	TRUMP	6	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	I do not say that.
183	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think science is real.
184	TRUMP	6	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	I do not say that.
185	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.
186	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And here's what we can do.
187	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.
188	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.
189	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can build a new modern electric grid.
190	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.
191	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.
192	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
193	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She talks about solar panels.
194	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We invested in a solar company, our country.
195	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was a disaster.
196	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They lost plenty of money on that one.
197	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.
198	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Our energy policies are a disaster.
199	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.
200	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.
201	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.
202	TRUMP	2	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.
203	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I will tell you this.
204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.
205	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.
206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.
207	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.
208	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've been doing this for 30 years.
209	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?
210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.
211	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, actually...
212	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will bring -- excuse me.
213	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will bring back jobs.
214	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can't bring back jobs.
215	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.
216	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, for 30 years.
217	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have -- well, not quite that long.
218	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.
219	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...
220	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, he approved NAFTA...
221	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
222	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	million new jobs, a balanced budget...
223	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.
224	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Incomes went up for everybody.
225	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.
226	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.
227	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Will they create jobs in America?
228	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Will they raise incomes in America?
229	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And are they good for our national security?
230	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Some of them I voted for.
231	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.
232	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.
233	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.
234	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.
235	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.
236	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.
237	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.
238	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We increased them to China 50 percent.
239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.
240	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very quickly...
241	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...
242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I've been a senator, Donald...
243	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You haven't done it.
244	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You haven't done it.
245	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have been a secretary of state...
246	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me.
247	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have done a lot...
248	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.
249	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that's your opinion.
250	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is your opinion.
251	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.
252	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.
253	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.
254	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were totally in favor of it.
255	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.
256	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
257	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.
258	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Well, that is just not accurate.
259	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.
260	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I wrote about that in...
261	TRUMP	3	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	You called it the gold standard.
262	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
263	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.
264	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
265	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No.
266	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.
267	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.
268	CLINTON	4	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...
269	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not.
270	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.
271	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I wrote about that in my book...
272	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So is it President Obama's fault?
273	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	before you even announced.
274	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Is it President Obama's fault?
275	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, there are differences...
276	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?
277	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are...
278	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because he's pushing it.
279	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.
280	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.
281	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.
282	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you have no plan.
283	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But in -- oh, but I do.
284	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, you have no plan.
285	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, I have written a book about it.
286	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"It's called ""Stronger Together."""
287	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...
288	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's about all you've...
289	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
290	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Folks, we're going to...
291	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	or at an airport near you.
292	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to move to...
293	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.
294	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.
295	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have a very robust set of plans.
296	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.
297	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.
298	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.
299	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You are going to drive business out.
300	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.
301	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.
302	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm very proud of it.
303	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.
304	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.
305	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.
306	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.
307	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.
308	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.
309	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to cut regulations.
310	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.
311	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment.
312	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to talk taxes...
313	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.
314	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.
315	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...
316	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Facts.
317	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.
318	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.
319	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because what I have proposed...
320	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.
321	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.
322	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.
323	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.
324	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.
325	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you just opened the next segment.
326	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, could I just finish -- I think I...
327	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
328	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to give you a chance right here...
329	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.
330	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	with a new 15-minute segment...
331	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.
332	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, I'm going to...
333	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And look at her website.
334	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know what?
335	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's no difference than this.
336	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.
337	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just go to her website.
338	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.
339	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.
340	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The next segment, we're continuing...
341	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.
342	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	achieving prosperity...
343	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.
344	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, we're not.
345	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, we're not.
346	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.
347	TRUMP	6	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.
348	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.
349	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, you are unpacking a lot here.
350	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.
351	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to talk about taxes.
352	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.
353	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.
354	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like you to further defend that.
355	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.
356	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like you to defend that.
357	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.
358	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.
359	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're going to expand their companies.
360	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're going to do a tremendous job.
361	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.
362	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.
363	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a great thing for the middle class.
364	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a great thing for companies to expand.
365	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.
366	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.
367	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.
368	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.
369	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.
370	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And here's the thing.
371	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.
372	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I happen to think it's double that.
373	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.
374	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.
375	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we have no leadership.
376	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.
377	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
378	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.
379	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.
380	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why not?
381	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why not?
382	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, why not?
383	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
384	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.
385	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...
386	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.
387	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.
388	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
389	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.
390	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've looked at your tax proposals.
391	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.
392	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I happen to support that.
393	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then you didn't read it.
394	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.
395	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.
396	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've proposed an approach that has a...
397	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who gave it that name?
398	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The first I've -- who gave it that name?
399	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
400	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.
401	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	$4 billion tax benefit for your family.
402	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when you look at what you are proposing...
403	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How much?
404	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How much for my family?
405	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	it is...
406	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lester, how much?
407	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.
408	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Trickle-down did not work.
409	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.
410	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.
411	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.
412	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.
413	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think top-down works in America.
414	CLINTON	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.
415	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.
416	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.
417	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, we're...
418	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Typical politician.
419	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All talk, no action.
420	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sounds good, doesn't work.
421	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Never going to happen.
422	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.
423	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.
424	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.
425	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.
426	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.
427	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we better be awfully careful.
428	TRUMP	4	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.
429	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.
430	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.
431	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.
432	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.
433	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.
434	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.
435	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?
436	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.
437	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it'll be released.
438	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.
439	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.
440	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.
441	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.
442	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
443	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.
444	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know what that is?
445	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?
446	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.
447	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The IRS says an audit...
448	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me.
449	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.
450	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...
451	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.
452	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.
453	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.
454	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I said, do you get audited?
455	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I get audited almost every year.
456	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in a way, I should be complaining.
457	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not even complaining.
458	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't mind it.
459	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's almost become a way of life.
460	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I get audited by the IRS.
461	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But other people don't.
462	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will say this.
463	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.
464	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.
465	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As soon as she releases them, I will release.
466	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
467	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will release my tax returns.
468	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""
469	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will tell you this.
470	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.
471	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.
472	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.
473	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.
474	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So it's negotiable?
475	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not negotiable, no.
476	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let her release the e-mails.
477	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why did she delete 33,000...
478	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'll let her answer that.
479	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let me just admonish the audience one more time.
480	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There was an agreement.
481	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.
482	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
483	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.
484	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.
485	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.
486	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.
487	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?
488	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.
489	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.
490	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.
491	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.
492	CLINTON	3	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.
493	TRUMP	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	That makes me smart.
494	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.
495	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.
496	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.
497	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.
498	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.
499	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.
500	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we'll guess.
501	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.
502	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?
503	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who does he owe money to?
504	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.
505	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.
506	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you want to respond to that?
507	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do.
508	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.
509	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's for sure.
510	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.
511	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'm not going to make any excuses.
512	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.
513	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
514	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was more than a mistake.
515	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was done purposely.
516	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK?
517	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was not a mistake.
518	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was done purposely.
519	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.
520	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.
521	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.
522	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That I can tell you.
523	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.
524	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you should go down and take a look at that.
525	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.
526	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.
527	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.
528	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.
529	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the $650 isn't even on that.
530	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's not $650.
531	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's much less than that.
532	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.
533	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.
534	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I could do that very quickly.
535	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am very underleveraged.
536	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a great company.
537	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a tremendous income.
538	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.
539	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.
540	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.
541	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our airports are like from a third world country.
542	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.
543	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the worst of all things has happened.
544	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.
545	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We haven't even started.
546	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.
547	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.
548	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's really a shame.
549	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.
550	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our country has tremendous problems.
551	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're a debtor nation.
552	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're a serious debtor nation.
553	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.
554	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.
555	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.
556	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.
557	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
558	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the other thing I think is important...
559	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It would be squandered, too, believe me.
560	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.
561	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.
562	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.
563	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.
564	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.
565	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a beautiful facility.
566	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It immediately was put to use.
567	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...
568	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...
569	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, to...
570	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which our country should do, too.
571	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?
572	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.
573	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.
574	CLINTON	3	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.
575	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.
576	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You call yourself the King of Debt.
577	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You talk about leverage.
578	CLINTON	5	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.
579	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
580	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
581	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.
582	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's let Mr. Trump...
583	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we need to be very clear about that.
584	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.
585	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.
586	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I built an unbelievable company.
587	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.
588	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's an unbelievable company.
589	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.
590	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.
591	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.
592	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.
593	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.
594	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what I do.
595	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.
596	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll give you an example.
597	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.
598	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we're opening the Old Post Office.
599	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.
600	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm a year ahead of schedule.
601	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what this country should be doing.
602	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.
603	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.
604	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.
605	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.
606	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we should be able to do that for our country.
607	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.
608	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.
609	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let's start by talking about race.
610	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.
611	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.
612	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So how do you heal the divide?
613	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.
614	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you're right.
615	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.
616	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.
617	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.
618	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we've got to do several things at the same time.
619	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.
620	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.
621	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.
622	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.
623	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.
624	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.
625	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.
626	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.
627	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.
628	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.
629	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have to do two things, as I said.
630	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to restore trust.
631	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to work with the police.
632	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.
633	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.
634	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
635	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you heal the divide?
636	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.
637	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we need law and order.
638	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.
639	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.
640	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.
641	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.
642	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.
643	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You walk down the street, you get shot.
644	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.
645	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Thousands of shootings.
646	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I'm saying, where is this?
647	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Is this a war-torn country?
648	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	What are we doing?
649	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we have to stop the violence.
650	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We have to bring back law and order.
651	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.
652	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We have to bring back law and order.
653	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.
654	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	It brought the crime rate way down.
655	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.
656	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have gangs roaming the street.
657	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.
658	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they have guns.
659	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they shoot people.
660	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have to be very strong.
661	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have to be very vigilant.
662	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.
663	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.
664	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.
665	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.
666	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.
667	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	No, you're wrong.
668	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.
669	TRUMP	3	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	It was taken away from her.
670	TRUMP	3	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.
671	TRUMP	3	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	They would have won an appeal.
672	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.
673	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.
674	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.
675	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	These are felons.
676	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.
677	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You need more police.
678	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You need a better community, you know, relation.
679	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.
680	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's terrible.
681	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have property there.
682	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.
683	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.
684	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You need better relationships.
685	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.
686	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.
687	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.
688	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So there's some bad things going on.
689	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some really bad things.
690	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
691	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.
692	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.
693	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.
694	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
695	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.
696	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ugh.
697	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.
698	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.
699	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.
700	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.
701	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.
702	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It did not do what it needed to do.
703	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I believe in community policing.
704	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.
705	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Property crime is down 40 percent.
706	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just don't want to see it creep back up.
707	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.
708	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.
709	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.
710	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.
711	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.
712	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot just say law and order.
713	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.
714	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to have more second chance programs.
715	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.
716	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.
717	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.
718	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.
719	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.
720	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.
721	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.
722	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.
723	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.
724	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.
725	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.
726	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?
727	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.
728	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.
729	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?
730	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.
731	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.
732	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They admit it's an issue.
733	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've got a lot of concerns.
734	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.
735	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.
736	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.
737	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
738	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to respond to that.
739	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please.
740	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.
741	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree with you.
742	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.
743	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.
744	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.
745	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.
746	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.
747	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.
748	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.
749	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you've apologized for it.
750	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.
751	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.
752	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.
753	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.
754	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.
755	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.
756	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?
757	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we went from 2,200 to 500.
758	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.
759	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And it was terminated by current mayor.
760	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.
761	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Tremendous beyond belief.
762	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.
763	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	It had a very, very big impact.
764	CLINTON	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.
765	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So there is...
766	TRUMP	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, you're wrong.
767	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're wrong.
768	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I'm not.
769	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	Murders are up.
770	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
771	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You check it.
772	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.
773	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.
774	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.
775	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, one murder is too many.
776	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.
777	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.
778	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?
779	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.
780	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.
781	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This conversation is about race.
782	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...
783	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to just respond, if I might.
784	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please -- 20 seconds.
785	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd just like to respond.
786	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.
787	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will.
788	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.
789	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.
790	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.
791	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.
792	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.
793	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, let me...
794	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
795	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I -- I do think...
796	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.
797	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.
798	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will tell you, I've been all over.
799	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.
800	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.
801	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, I...
802	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.
803	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, I did.
804	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know what else I prepared for?
805	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I prepared to be president.
806	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that's a good thing.
807	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
808	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.
809	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You questioned his legitimacy.
810	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.
811	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can you tell us what took you so long?
812	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.
813	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.
814	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.
815	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.
816	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.
817	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.
818	TRUMP	6	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	They were pressing it very hard.
819	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She failed to get the birth certificate.
820	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I got involved, I didn't fail.
821	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I got him to give the birth certificate.
822	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'm satisfied with it.
823	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.
824	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was...
825	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
826	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.
827	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will let you respond.
828	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's important.
829	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I just want to get the answer here.
830	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The birth certificate was produced in 2011.
831	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...
832	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah.
833	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	as recently as January.
834	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the question is, what changed your mind?
835	TRUMP	3	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.
836	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.
837	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But nobody was caring much about it.
838	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.
839	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think I did a good job.
840	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton also fought it.
841	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.
842	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, it's true.
843	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.
844	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she was involved.
845	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.
846	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm sorry.
847	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.
848	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.
849	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What do you say to Americans, people of color who...
850	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
851	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.
852	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.
853	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He should have produced it a long time before.
854	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I say nothing.
855	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let me just tell you.
856	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.
857	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you can see that.
858	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.
859	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.
860	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
861	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, just listen to what you heard.
862	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
863	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.
864	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it can't be dismissed that easily.
865	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.
866	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.
867	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.
868	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.
869	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.
870	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.
871	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.
872	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.
873	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.
874	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.
875	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.
876	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would love to respond.
877	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.
878	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You treated him with terrible disrespect.
879	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.
880	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It doesn't work that way.
881	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.
882	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think you can deny that.
883	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.
884	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.
885	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It really doesn't.
886	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.
887	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.
888	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was very easy to do.
889	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I notice you bring that up a lot.
890	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.
891	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.
892	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?
893	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.
894	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll go one step further.
895	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.
896	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.
897	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's a tremendously successful club.
898	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm so glad I did it.
899	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have been given great credit for what I did.
900	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm very, very proud of it.
901	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's the way I feel.
902	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is the true way I feel.
903	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Our next segment is called ""Securing America."""
904	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.
905	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.
906	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So my question is, who's behind it?
907	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how do we fight it?
908	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.
909	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.
910	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.
911	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.
912	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.
913	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.
914	CLINTON	4	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...
915	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
916	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	tough, long game here.
917	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.
918	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.
919	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.
920	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.
921	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.
922	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.
923	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we will defend the citizens of this country.
924	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the Russians need to understand that.
925	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.
926	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.
927	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is just unacceptable.
928	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...
929	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes have expired.
930	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.
931	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.
932	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.
933	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who's behind it?
934	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how do we fight it?
935	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.
936	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That just happened, and many more are coming.
937	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm very proud of it.
938	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.
939	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.
940	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I was just endorsed by ICE.
941	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.
942	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.
943	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK?
944	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because look at the mess that we're in.
945	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look at the mess that we're in.
946	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.
947	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.
948	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.
949	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.
950	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.
951	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It could also be lots of other people.
952	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?
953	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't know who broke in to DNC.
954	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what did we learn with DNC?
955	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
956	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look what happened to her.
957	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.
958	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what we learned.
959	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.
960	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.
961	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	ISIS.
962	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.
963	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is -- it is a huge problem.
964	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a son.
965	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's 10 years old.
966	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has computers.
967	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.
968	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.
969	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And maybe it's hardly doable.
970	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.
971	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.
972	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.
973	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
974	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.
975	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.
976	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It does involve going after them online.
977	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.
978	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.
979	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're making progress.
980	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our military is assisting in Iraq.
981	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.
982	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.
983	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.
984	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.
985	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.
986	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.
987	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.
988	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll ask this to both of you.
989	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?
990	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.
991	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.
992	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will take out ISIS.
993	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.
994	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	And ISIS was formed.
995	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So she talks about taking them out.
996	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's been doing it a long time.
997	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.
998	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.
999	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then you wouldn't have had them.
1000	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.
1001	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.
1002	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
1003	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.
1004	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.
1005	TRUMP	4	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	Wrong.
1006	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is absolutely proved over and over again.
1007	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
1008	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
1009	CLINTON	3	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.
1010	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.
1011	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.
1012	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.
1013	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?
1014	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the most important part of this.
1015	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do we prevent attacks?
1016	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do we protect our people?
1017	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.
1018	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.
1019	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.
1020	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they brought him down.
1021	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.
1022	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.
1023	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.
1024	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.
1025	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.
1026	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.
1027	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're on the front lines.
1028	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.
1029	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.
1030	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
1031	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I have to respond.
1032	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please respond.
1033	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.
1034	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.
1035	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Under your direction, to a large extent.
1036	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.
1037	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They were choking on the sanctions.
1038	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.
1039	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?
1040	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.
1041	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did really well.
1042	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I have common sense.
1043	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I said, well, I'll tell you.
1044	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.
1045	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But two things.
1046	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.
1047	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.
1048	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.
1049	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was very strong.
1050	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I said it numerous times.
1051	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.
1052	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that's great.
1053	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.
1054	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a lot of money to protect other people.
1055	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'm all for NATO.
1056	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.
1057	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they're going to do that.
1058	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
1059	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.
1060	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.
1061	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not only that, you named the day.
1062	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They couldn't believe it.
1063	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.
1064	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They said...
1065	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lester, we've covered...
1066	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, wait a minute.
1067	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've covered this ground.
1068	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.
1069	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It should have never happened.
1070	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.
1071	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.
1072	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now it's in over 30 countries.
1073	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you're going to stop them?
1074	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think so.
1075	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.
1076	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.
1077	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What makes your...
1078	TRUMP	4	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	I did not support the war in Iraq.
1079	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In 2002...
1080	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.
1081	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My question is, since you supported it...
1082	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just -- would you like to hear...
1083	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	why is your -- why is your judgment...
1084	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait a minute.
1085	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I was against the war in Iraq.
1086	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just so you put it out.
1087	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...
1088	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The record does not show that.
1089	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why was -- is your judgment any...
1090	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The record shows that I'm right.
1091	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?
1092	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Essentially.
1093	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.
1094	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We talked about the economy is more important.
1095	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.
1096	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.
1097	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.
1098	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why is your judgment better than...
1099	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when he -- excuse me.
1100	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that was before the war started.
1101	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.
1102	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was against the war.
1103	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.
1104	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.
1105	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But nobody called Sean Hannity.
1106	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.
1107	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think in '04.
1108	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.
1109	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.
1110	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.
1111	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He and I used to have arguments about the war.
1112	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.
1113	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.
1114	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's exactly what it's done.
1115	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been a disaster.
1116	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...
1117	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, no.
1118	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You didn't hear what I said.
1119	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?
1120	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.
1121	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's no question about that.
1122	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?
1123	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
1124	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.
1125	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have a winning temperament.
1126	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know how to win.
1127	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She does not have a...
1128	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
1129	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait.
1130	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.
1131	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.
1132	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
1133	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Whew, OK.
1134	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
1135	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.
1136	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.
1137	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?
1138	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.
1139	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.
1140	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.
1141	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They had built covert facilities.
1142	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.
1143	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we had sanctioned them.
1144	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.
1145	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.
1146	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.
1147	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.
1148	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's diplomacy.
1149	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's coalition-building.
1150	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's working with other nations.
1151	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.
1152	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.
1153	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not good judgment.
1154	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That would not start a war.
1155	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.
1156	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the worst part...
1157	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, they were taunting us.
1158	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.
1159	CLINTON	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
1160	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
1161	CLINTON	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...
1162	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
1163	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	have a good time, folks.
1164	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's lies.
1165	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.
1166	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.
1167	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.
1168	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.
1169	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.
1170	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like to...
1171	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a good one, though.
1172	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It well describes the problem.
1173	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
1174	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not an accurate one at all.
1175	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not an accurate one.
1176	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.
1177	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree with her on one thing.
1178	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.
1179	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.
1180	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.
1181	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They do not pay us.
1182	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.
1183	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.
1184	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.
1185	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.
1186	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...
1187	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to move on.
1188	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, wait, but it's very important.
1189	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.
1190	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.
1191	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have to help us out.
1192	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our last...
1193	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.
1194	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.
1195	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.
1196	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.
1197	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you support the current policy?
1198	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.
1199	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.
1200	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.
1201	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.
1202	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I looked the other night.
1203	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.
1204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.
1205	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.
1206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I would certainly not do first strike.
1207	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.
1208	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At the same time, we have to be prepared.
1209	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can't take anything off the table.
1210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.
1211	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	China should solve that problem for us.
1212	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	China should go into North Korea.
1213	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.
1214	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.
1215	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.
1216	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iran has power over North Korea.
1217	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.
1218	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.
1219	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?
1220	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?
1221	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.
1222	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody's ever seen that before.
1223	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That turned out to be wrong.
1224	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.
1225	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It certainly looks that way.
1226	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?
1227	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.
1228	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.
1229	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.
1230	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes is expired.
1231	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.
1232	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.
1233	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me, he's not a happy camper.
1234	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
1235	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
1236	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.
1237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Words matter when you run for president.
1238	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they really matter when you are president.
1239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.
1240	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is essential that America's word be good.
1241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.
1242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've talked with a number of them.
1243	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.
1244	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.
1245	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.
1246	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.
1247	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Donald never tells you what he would do.
1248	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would he have started a war?
1249	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would he have bombed Iran?
1250	CLINTON	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.
1251	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.
1252	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.
1253	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.
1254	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.
1255	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can they rely on us?
1256	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?
1257	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what I intend to do.
1258	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.
1259	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...
1260	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes is...
1261	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	to be given any opportunities at all.
1262	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	is expired.
1263	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lester, one thing I'd like to say.
1264	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very quickly.
1265	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Twenty seconds.
1266	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will go very quickly.
1267	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.
1268	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.
1269	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
1270	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's a big problem.
1271	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.
1272	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot be the policemen of the world.
1273	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot protect countries all over the world...
1274	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have just...
1275	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	where they're not paying us what we need.
1276	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have just a few final questions...
1277	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.
1278	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need heart.
1279	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need a lot of things.
1280	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you have to have some basic ability.
1281	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And sadly, she doesn't have that.
1282	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.
1283	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they weren't taken care of.
1284	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.
1285	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.
1286	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."""
1287	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's standing here right now.
1288	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What did you mean by that?
1289	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't have the look.
1290	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't have the stamina.
1291	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I said she doesn't have the stamina.
1292	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.
1293	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.
1294	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look."""
1295	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have -- wait a minute.
1296	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait a minute, Lester.
1297	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You asked me a question.
1298	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did you ask me a question?
1299	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.
1300	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.
1301	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?
1302	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?
1303	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	All you have to do is speak to them.
1304	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait.
1305	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.
1306	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's let her respond.
1307	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.
1308	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1309	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The world -- let me tell you.
1310	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you.
1311	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.
1312	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.
1313	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1314	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's bad, bad experience.
1315	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.
1316	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree.
1317	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.
1318	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.
1319	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are at -- we are at the final question.
1320	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1321	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, one thing.
1322	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One thing, Lester.
1323	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.
1324	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.
1325	CLINTON	3	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...
1326	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I never said that.
1327	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
1328	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I didn't say that.
1329	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.
1330	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.
1331	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""
1332	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."
1333	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald, she has a name.
1334	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where did you find this?
1335	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where did you find this?
1336	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her name is Alicia Machado.
1337	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where did you find this?
1338	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...
1339	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, really?
1340	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	she's going to vote this November.
1341	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, good.
1342	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me just tell you...
1343	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1344	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...
1345	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.
1346	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some of it's said in entertainment.
1347	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.
1348	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you want to know the truth?
1349	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was going to say something...
1350	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please very quickly.
1351	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."
1352	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just can't do it.
1353	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's inappropriate.
1354	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"It's not nice."""
1355	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.
1356	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're untrue.
1357	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they're misrepresentations.
1358	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.
1359	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I don't deserve that.
1360	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.
1361	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's hundreds of millions of ads.
1362	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...
1363	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to move on to the final question.
1364	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.
1365	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1366	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One of you will not win this election.
1367	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?
1368	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
1369	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I support our democracy.
1370	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
1371	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.
1372	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.
1373	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.
1374	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.
1375	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question.
1376	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?
1377	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to make America great again.
1378	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We are a nation that is seriously troubled.
1379	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We're losing our jobs.
1380	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	People are pouring into our country.
1381	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	The other day, we were deporting 800 people.
1382	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.
1383	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Ended up becoming citizens.
1384	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And it was 800.
1385	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.
1386	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Will you accept the outcome of the election?
1387	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, here's the story.
1388	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to make America great again.
1389	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to be able to do it.
1390	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't believe Hillary will.
1391	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.
1392	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1393	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
1394	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that is going to do it for us.
1395	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.
1396	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.
1397	HOLT	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.
