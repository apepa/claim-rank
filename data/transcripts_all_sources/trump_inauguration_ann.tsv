4	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
5	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
6	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.

9	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
10	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
11	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
12	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
13	TRUMP	5	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
14	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
15	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
16	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Their victories have not been your victories.
17	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
18	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
19	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
20	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment, it belongs to you.
21	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
22	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
23	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is your day.
24	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is your celebration.
25	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this, the United States of America, is your country.
26	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
27	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
28	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
29	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
30	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)

32	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
33	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everyone is listening to you now.
34	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.
35	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
36	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
37	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
38	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
39	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
40		4	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
41		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
42		3	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
43		6	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
44	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
45	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) We are one nation and their pain is our pain.
46	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Their dreams are our dreams.
47	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And their success will be our success.
48	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
49	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
50	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
51	TRUMP	7	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
52	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
53	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
54	TRUMP	5	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
55	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
56	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
57	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
58	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that is the past.
59	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And now, we are looking only to the future.
60	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)

64	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
65	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
66	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
67	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
68	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

82	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
83	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
84	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.
85	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will shine for everyone to follow.
86	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)

88	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
89	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
90	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
91	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
92	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
93	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
