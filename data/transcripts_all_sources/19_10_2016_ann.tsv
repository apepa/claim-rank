0	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
1	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
2	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
3	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.
4	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.
5	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.
6	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.
7	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.
8	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.
9	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.
10	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
11	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.
12	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's get right to it.
13	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The first topic is the Supreme Court.
14	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.
15	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.
16	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?
17	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?
18	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?
19	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.
20	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have two minutes.
21	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much, Chris.
22	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.
23	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?
24	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?
25	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What kind of rights will Americans have?
26	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.
27	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.
28	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.
29	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.
30	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.
31	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I look forward to having that opportunity.
32	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.
33	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.
34	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.
35	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
36	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, same question.
37	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where do you want to see the court take the country?
38	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?
39	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.
40	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.
41	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.
42	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.
43	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	And she was forced to apologize.
44	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	And apologize she did.
45	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.
46	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.
47	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.
48	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.
49	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.
50	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They will have a conservative bent.
51	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.
52	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.
53	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.
54	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I believe that's very, very important.
55	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.
56	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.
57	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And those are the people that I will appoint.
58	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, thank you.
59	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.
60	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.
61	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.
62	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."
63	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.
64	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.
65	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What's wrong with that?
66	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.
67	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.
68	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I represented upstate New York.
69	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.
70	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It goes back to the founding of our country.
71	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.
72	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.
73	CLINTON	4	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.
74	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.
75	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.
76	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You mentioned the Heller decision.
77	CLINTON	3	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.
78	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.
79	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.
80	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.
81	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.
82	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?
83	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.
84	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?
85	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.
86	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I watched.
87	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.
88	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Justice Scalia was so involved.
89	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it was a well-crafted decision.
90	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.
91	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.
92	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.
93	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Were you extremely upset?
94	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.
95	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.
96	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.
97	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.
98	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The gun lobby's on his side.
99	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.
100	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.
101	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.
102	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.
103	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You support a national right to carry law.
104	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why, sir?
105	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.
106	TRUMP	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.
107	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.
108	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
109	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.
110	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.
111	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'm very honored by all of that.
112	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.
113	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.
114	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.
115	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
116	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.
117	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?
118	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.
119	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'm asking you specifically.
120	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would you like to...
121	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.
122	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.
123	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?
124	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.
125	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.
126	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.
127	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
128	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.
129	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.
130	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is about what's happening right now in America.
131	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.
132	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.
133	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.
134	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will defend Planned Parenthood.
135	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.
136	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton…
137	CLINTON 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.
138	WALLACE	3	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.
139	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.
140	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.
141	WALLACE	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.
142	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.
143	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why?
144	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.
145	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.
146	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.
147	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.
148	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.
149	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.
150	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, your reaction?
151	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.
152	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think it's terrible.
153	TRUMP	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.
154	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.
155	TRUMP	5	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.
156	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's not acceptable.
157	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.
158	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
159	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.
160	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.
161	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I do not believe the government should be making it.
162	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.
163	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.
164	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.
165	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will stand up for that right.
166	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
167	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...
168	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.
169	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody has that.
170	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
171	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's move on to the subject of immigration.
172	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.
173	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.
174	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.
175	WALLACE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.
176	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.
177	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.
178	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?
179	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.
180	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have two minutes.
181	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.
182	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need strong borders.
183	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.
184	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.
185	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're coming in illegally.
186	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Drugs are pouring in through the border.
187	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have no country if we have no border.
188	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Hillary wants to give amnesty.
189	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	She wants to have open borders.
190	TRUMP	4	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.
191	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.
192	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It means their job is tougher.
193	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they know what's going on.
194	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They know it better than anybody.
195	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They want strong borders.
196	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They feel we have to have strong borders.
197	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
198	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.
199	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
200	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
201	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.
202	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to have strong borders.
203	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.
204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.
205	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need strong borders.
206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.
207	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I want to build the wall.
208	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We need the wall.
209	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.
210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We stop the drugs.
211	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We shore up the border.
212	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.
213	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.
214	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.
215	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.
216	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, thank you.
217	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.
218	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?
219	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.
220	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.
221	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you're right.
222	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't want to rip families apart.
223	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.
224	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.
225	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have 11 million undocumented people.
226	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.
227	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.
228	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, here's what that means.
229	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.
230	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.
231	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.
232	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.
233	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have been for border security for years.
234	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.
235	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.
236	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.
237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.
238	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.
239	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Didn't even raise it.
240	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.
241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.
242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.
243	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
244	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to follow up...
245	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Chris, I think it's...
246	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
247	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think I should respond to that.
248	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.
249	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very nice man.
250	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.
251	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
252	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.
253	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It's a disaster.
254	TRUMP	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
255	TRUMP	3	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.
256	TRUMP	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.
257	TRUMP	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
258	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...
259	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are a country of laws.
260	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We either have -- and by the way...
261	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, wait.
262	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to hear from...
263	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well -- well, but she said one thing.
264	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
265	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I voted for border security, and there are...
266	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the wall.
267	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.
268	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
269	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.
270	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.
271	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And Donald knows a lot about this.
272	CLINTON	5	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.
273	CLINTON	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported."
274	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.
275	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
276	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	President Obama has moved millions of people out.
277	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.
278	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.
279	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They've been deported.
280	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.
281	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.
282	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're a country of laws.
283	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We either have a border or we don't.
284	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.
285	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's very unfair.
286	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have millions of people that did it the right way.
287	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're on line.
288	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're waiting.
289	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.
290	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.
291	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.
292	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.
293	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to...
294	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
295	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, I want to...
296	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	We will not have open borders.
297	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is...
298	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me -- Secretary...
299	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is a rank mischaracterization.
300	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
301	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.
302	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.
303	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ronald Reagan was the last president...
304	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, excuse me.
305	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton.
306	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.
307	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.
308	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.
309	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So that's the question...
310	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
311	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the question.
312	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please quiet, everybody.
313	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Is that your dream, open borders?
314	CLINTON	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.
315	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.
316	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.
317	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that would be a great benefit to us.
318	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.
319	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
320	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.
321	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
322	CLINTON	2	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.
323	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?
324	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those are the questions we need answered.
325	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.
326	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well?
327	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?
328	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How did we get on to Putin?
329	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hold on -- hold on, wait.
330	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hold on, folks.
331	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.
332	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.
333	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So just to finish on the borders...
334	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes?
335	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	She wants open borders.
336	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People are going to pour into our country.
337	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	People are going to come in from Syria.
338	TRUMP	5	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.
339	TRUMP	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	They have no idea where they come from.
340	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.
341	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.
342	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.
343	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now we can talk about Putin.
344	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	I don't know Putin.
345	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	He said nice things about me.
346	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we got along well, that would be good.
347	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.
348	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has no respect for her.
349	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	He has no respect for our president.
350	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.
351	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she's playing chicken.
352	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, Putin...
353	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait, but...
354	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.
355	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.
356	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No puppet.
357	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No puppet.
358	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's pretty clear...
359	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're the puppet!
360	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's pretty clear you won't admit...
361	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, you're the puppet.
362	CLINTON	4	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.
363	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.
364	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.
365	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.
366	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I find that deeply disturbing.
367	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
368	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's time you take a stand...
369	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.
370	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am not quoting myself.
371	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	She has no idea.
372	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am quoting 17...
373	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary, you have no idea.
374	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
375	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	And our country has no idea.
376	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... agencies.
377	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, I doubt it.
378	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I doubt it.
379	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.
380	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I find that just absolutely...
381	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
382	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
383	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
384	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me.
385	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.
386	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
387	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
388	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.
389	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do get to ask some questions.
390	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, that's fine.
391	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I would like to ask you this direct question.
392	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.
393	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?
394	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By Russia or anybody else.
395	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You condemn their interference?
396	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course I condemn.
397	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course I -- I don't know Putin.
398	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have no idea.
399	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?
400	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I never met Putin.
401	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is not my best friend.
402	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.
403	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.
404	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Whether it's Syria, you name it.
405	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Missiles.
406	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at the "start up" that they signed.
407	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.
408	TRUMP	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They create warheads, and we can't.
409	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Russians can't believe it.
410	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She has been outsmarted by Putin.
411	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.
412	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've taken over.
413	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've spent $6 trillion.
414	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've taken over the Middle East.
415	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.
416	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic.
417	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You got about 45 seconds.
418	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she always will be.
419	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.
420	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.
421	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's...
422	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	Wrong.
423	CLINTON	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
424	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.
425	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But here's the deal.
426	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
427	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
428	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.
429	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have 200 generals...
430	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very quickly.
431	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.
432	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.
433	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are spending a fortune doing it.
434	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have the bargain of the century.
435	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.
436	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.
437	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
438	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.
439	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is just another lie.
440	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...
441	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's no quote.
442	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	You're not going to find a quote from me.
443	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.
444	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That kind...
445	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And defend yourselves.
446	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... of language -- well...
447	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And defend yourselves.
448	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	I didn't say nuclear.
449	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And defend yourself.
450	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.
451	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald wants to tear up our alliances.
452	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.
453	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.
454	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.
455	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.
456	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.
457	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.
458	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.
459	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.
460	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.
461	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
462	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.
463	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.
464	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.
465	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.
466	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.
467	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.
468	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.
469	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.
470	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want us to do more to help small business.
471	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.
472	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.
473	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.
474	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.
475	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.
476	CLINTON	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.
477	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.
478	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.
479	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.
480	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.
481	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.
482	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.
483	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why?
484	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.
485	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.
486	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.
487	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, thank you.
488	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?
489	TRUMP	4	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.
490	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her tax plan is a disaster.
491	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.
492	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm a big proponent.
493	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.
494	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.
495	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.
496	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.
497	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.
498	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We protect Saudi Arabia.
499	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why aren't they paying?
500	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.
501	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?
502	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because they weren't paying.
503	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.
504	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.
505	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.
506	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They have to pay up.
507	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.
508	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm a big fan of NATO.
509	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	But they have to pay up.
510	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.
511	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.
512	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.
513	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.
514	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're up to $20 trillion.
515	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.
516	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have a lot of free trade.
517	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.
518	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we have horrible deals.
519	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.
520	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.
521	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.
522	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You go upstate New York.
523	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.
524	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're bringing our jobs back.
525	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
526	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.
527	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.
528	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.
529	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to cut taxes massively.
530	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to cut business taxes massively.
531	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're going to start hiring people.
532	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...
533	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Time, Mr. Trump.
534	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... that's offshore back into the country.
535	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...
536	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
537	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.
538	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...
539	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can't.
540	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.
541	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.
542	CLINTON	6	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	I also will not add a penny to the debt.
543	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have costed out what I'm going to do.
544	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.
545	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, he mentioned the debt.
546	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We know how to get control of the debt.
547	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.
548	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.
549	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.
550	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.
551	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.
552	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the kind of approach that will work.
553	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary...
554	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.
555	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.
556	WALLACE	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.
557	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Correct.
558	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, sir.
559	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.
560	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?
561	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it's a combination, Chris.
562	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.
563	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.
564	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.
565	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
566	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
567	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it was a terrible recession.
568	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.
569	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.
570	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not going to work.
571	CLINTON	6	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.
572	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.
573	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.
574	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...
575	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Over a 10-year period.
576	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... growth is unrealistic.
577	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.
578	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well.
579	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your response, sir?
580	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I just left some high representatives of India.
581	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're growing at 8 percent.
582	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	China is growing at 7 percent.
583	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that for them is a catastrophically low number.
584	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.
585	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's going down.
586	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.
587	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	A terrible jobs report.
588	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?
589	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.
590	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The report was so bad.
591	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Look, our country is stagnant.
592	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	We've lost our jobs.
593	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	We've lost our businesses.
594	TRUMP	4	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.
595	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.
596	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've visited so many communities.
597	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.
598	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.
599	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they cry when they see what's happened.
600	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.
601	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.
602	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Boy, did they suffer.
603	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.
604	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.
605	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she wants it.
606	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.
607	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She totally lied.
608	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She did call it the gold standard.
609	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.
610	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was so honored.
611	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...
612	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.
613	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... which is Obamacare.
614	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But go ahead, briefly.
615	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.
616	CLINTON	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It didn't meet my test.
617	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've had the same test.
618	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?
619	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm against it now.
620	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll be against it after the election.
621	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll be against it when I'm president.
622	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.
623	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.
624	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But he mentioned China.
625	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.
626	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have fought against that as a senator.
627	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've stood up against it as secretary of state.
628	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.
629	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.
630	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.
631	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
632	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
633	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.
634	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to pull the country together.
635	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.
636	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.
637	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.
638	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
639	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
640	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me ask a simple question.
641	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's been doing this for 30 years.
642	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?
643	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I voted.
644	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were very much involved -- excuse me.
645	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My turn.
646	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.
647	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very much.
648	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you do have experience.
649	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.
650	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.
651	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I wouldn't mind.
652	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.
653	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't.
654	TRUMP	6	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.
655	TRUMP	8	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	How do you miss $6 billion?
656	TRUMP	8	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.
657	TRUMP	5	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	They don't know.
658	TRUMP	8	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	It's gone, $6 billion.
659	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.
660	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me.
661	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.
662	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think it's really an important issue.
663	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.
664	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.
665	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.
666	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.
667	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.
668	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.
669	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.
670	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.
671	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Give me a break.
672	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the "Celebrity Apprentice."
673	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.
674	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think I did a much better job.
675	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.
676	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	I started with a $1 million loan.
677	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree with that.
678	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a $1 million loan.
679	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I built a phenomenal company.
680	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.
681	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You would even be proud of it.
682	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.
683	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at the migration.
684	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at Libya.
685	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at Iraq.
686	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.
687	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.
688	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.
689	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.
690	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's going to get rid of nobody.
691	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
692	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States.
693	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it.
694	WALLACE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.
695	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?
696	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse.
697	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you go first.
698	TRUMP	7	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.
699	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Those people -- I don't know those people.
700	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a feeling how they came.
701	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe it was her campaign that did it.
702	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?
703	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.
704	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.
705	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.
706	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.
707	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.
708	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.
709	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's her campaign.
710	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.
711	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.
712	TRUMP	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And that was now all on tape, started by her.
713	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.
714	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.
715	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.
716	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was lies, and it was fiction.
717	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
718	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
719	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.
720	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.
721	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, what was his response?
722	CLINTON	3	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.
723	TRUMP	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	I did not say that.
724	TRUMP	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	I did not say that.
725	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, he went on to say...
726	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.
727	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her two minutes.
728	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did not say that.
729	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's her two minutes.
730	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He went on to say, "Look at her.
731	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think so."
732	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	About another woman, he said, "That wouldn't be my first choice."
733	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her "disgusting," as he has called a number of women during this campaign.
734	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.
735	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.
736	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.
737	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's who Donald is.
738	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.
739	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America is great, because America is good.
740	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.
741	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
742	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
743	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody.
744	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
745	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody has more respect...
746	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please, everybody.
747	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.
748	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.
749	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.
750	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
751	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.
752	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.
753	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	One lie.
754	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.
755	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's going to probably go to jail.
756	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a four-star general.
757	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?
758	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.
759	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
760	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.
761	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's not just about women.
762	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.
763	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.
764	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.
765	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	Wrong.
766	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.
767	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers "people who aren't captured."
768	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.
769	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So it's not one thing.
770	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.
771	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not who America is.
772	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.
773	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.
774	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.
775	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's on tape.
776	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	During the last...
777	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...
778	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
779	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.
780	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate.
781	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to ask you about them.
782	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are questions that the American people have.
783	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you.
784	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.
785	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?
786	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?
787	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.
788	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The State Department has said that.
789	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that's been proven.
790	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.
791	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.
792	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.
793	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In partnership with the American Health Association...
794	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
795	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...
796	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.
797	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it is an open discussion.
798	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you...
799	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the specific question went to pay for play.
800	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you want to talk about that?
801	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...
802	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
803	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that it's been very well...
804	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's ask Mr. Trump.
805	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...
806	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been very well studied.
807	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and the high rankings...
808	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
809	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please let me Mr. Trump speak.
810	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.
811	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please let Mr. Trump speak.
812	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
813	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	It's a criminal enterprise.
814	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.
815	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You talk about women and women's rights?
816	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.
817	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.
818	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And yet you take their money.
819	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?
820	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why don't you give back the money?
821	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it would be a great gesture.
822	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.
823	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.
824	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.
825	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.
826	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.
827	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
828	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.
829	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm very proud of that.
830	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.
831	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.
832	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, who does that?
833	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It just was astonishing.
834	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.
835	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.
836	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.
837	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.
838	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.
839	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...
840	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
841	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... because it's an important part of the American experience.
842	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They don't want you to help them anymore.
843	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
844	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to mention one thing.
845	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Trump Foundation, small foundation.
846	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	People contribute, I contribute.
847	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.
848	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't get anything.
849	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	I don't buy boats.
850	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	I don't buy planes.
851	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What happens -- the money goes to them.
852	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?
853	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	No, it was -- we put up the American flag.
854	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's it.
855	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	They put up the American flag.
856	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.
857	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
858	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...
859	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There was.
860	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There was.
861	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, by the way...
862	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.
863	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.
864	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to get into one...
865	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.
866	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.
867	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can look at our tax returns.
868	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got them all out there.
869	CLINTON	6	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.
870	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.
871	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.
872	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.
873	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I find that just astonishing.
874	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want...
875	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.
876	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...
877	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We...
878	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me just explain.
879	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, no, we heard this...
880	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.
881	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, we -- OK.
882	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know what she should have done?
883	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Folks, we heard this...
884	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...
885	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Folks, we heard this...
886	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.
887	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you know...
888	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You should have changed the law.
889	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.
890	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...
891	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Made with Chinese steel.
892	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will tell you, I sat there...
893	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
894	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.
895	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.
896	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.
897	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump...
898	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.
899	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.
900	WALLACE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.
901	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- "will absolutely accept the result of this election."
902	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing.
903	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?
904	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will look at it at the time.
905	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not looking at anything now.
906	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll look at it at the time.
907	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.
908	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.
909	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.
910	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's so dishonest.
911	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.
912	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.
913	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think they're going to see through it.
914	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll find out on November 8th.
915	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think they're going to see through it.
916	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, sir, there's...
917	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.
918	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let me just give you one other thing.
919	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I talk about the corrupt media.
920	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.
921	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She shouldn't be allowed to run.
922	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.
923	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She should not be allowed to run.
924	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...
925	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But...
926	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.
927	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.
928	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.
929	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?
930	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.
931	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll keep you in suspense.
932	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK?
933	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.
934	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.
935	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.
936	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.
937	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He lost the Iowa caucus.
938	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He lost the Wisconsin primary.
939	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.
940	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.
941	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
942	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Should have gotten it.
943	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
944	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is -- this is a mindset.
945	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is how Donald thinks.
946	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.
947	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
948	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So that is not the way our democracy works.
949	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've been around for 240 years.
950	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've had free and fair elections.
951	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.
952	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.
953	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...
954	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
955	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hold on.
956	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hold on, folks.
957	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hold on, folks.
958	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.
959	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.
960	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.
961	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.
962	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.
963	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's a disgrace.
964	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
965	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.
966	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
967	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hold on, folks.
968	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This doesn't do any good for anyone.
969	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.
970	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.
971	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?
972	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.
973	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?
974	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.
975	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have two minutes.
976	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.
977	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.
978	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.
979	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.
980	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The goal here is to take back Mosul.
981	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's going to be a hard fight.
982	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've got no illusions about that.
983	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.
984	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.
985	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we know we've got lots of work to do.
986	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.
987	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.
988	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.
989	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.
990	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.
991	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, same question.
992	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?
993	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.
994	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We had Mosul.
995	TRUMP	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.
996	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.
997	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.
998	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.
999	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?
1000	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We announce we're going after Mosul.
1001	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?
1002	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	These people have all left.
1003	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've all left.
1004	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The element of surprise.
1005	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.
1006	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.
1007	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.
1008	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?
1009	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.
1010	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They want to look good.
1011	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.
1012	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why we have the great migration.
1013	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she wanted to look good for the election.
1014	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So they're going in.
1015	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But who's going to get Mosul, really?
1016	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll take Mosul eventually.
1017	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.
1018	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Much, much tougher.
1019	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Much more dangerous.
1020	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Going to be more deaths that they thought.
1021	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.
1022	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They say, what do we need this for?
1023	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.
1024	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.
1025	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.
1026	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we're now going to take Mosul.
1027	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?
1028	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iran.
1029	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.
1030	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.
1031	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.
1032	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.
1033	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sir, your two minutes are up.
1034	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.
1035	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.
1036	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I said it was a mistake.
1037	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've said that years ago.
1038	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has consistently denied what is...
1039	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	Wrong.
1040	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... a very clear fact that...
1041	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
1042	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... before the invasion, he supported it.
1043	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.
1044	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Google "Donald Trump Iraq."
1045	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.
1046	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wrong.
1047	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.
1048	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, why does that matter?
1049	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.
1050	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
1051	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.
1052	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mosul is a Sunni city.
1053	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mosul is on the border of Syria.
1054	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing "Celebrity Apprentice," and we brought him to justice.
1055	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to go after the leadership.
1056	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.
1057	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.
1058	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've been digging underground.
1059	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've been prepared to defend.
1060	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's going to be tough fighting.
1061	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.
1062	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is what we have to do.
1063	CLINTON	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.
1064	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.
1065	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Chris, we don't gain anything.
1066	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has all the conspiracy theories...
1067	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1068	TRUMP	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Iran is taking over Iraq.
1069	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, it's...
1070	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1071	TRUMP	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Iran is taking over Iraq.
1072	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't gain anything.
1073	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.
1074	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If they did it by surprise...
1075	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1076	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.
1077	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He says...
1078	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1079	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We could have gained if they did it by surprise.
1080	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.
1081	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.
1082	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, you are the one that's unfit.
1083	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.
1084	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said some beauties.
1085	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.
1086	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You do.
1087	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.
1088	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you think that was good, then you do.
1089	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.
1090	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.
1091	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree with both.
1092	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.
1093	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he has said...
1094	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which is a big mistake.
1095	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.
1096	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think he's right.
1097	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's turn to Aleppo.
1098	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
1099	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir.
1100	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.
1101	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, there -- in fact, there are...
1102	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a catastrophe.
1103	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean...
1104	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a catastrophe, but there...
1105	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... it's a mess.
1106	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are a quarter of...
1107	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Have you seen it?
1108	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Have you seen it?
1109	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sir...
1110	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?
1111	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sir, if I may finish my question...
1112	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, so it hasn't fallen.
1113	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at it.
1114	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.
1115	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's right.
1116	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they are being slaughtered...
1117	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
1118	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... because of bad decisions.
1119	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS.
1120	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.
1121	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would you like to clear that up, sir?
1122	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.
1123	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a humanitarian nightmare.
1124	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.
1125	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?
1126	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at Aleppo.
1127	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is so sad when you see what's happened.
1128	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.
1129	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.
1130	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He -- he aligned with Russia.
1131	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.
1132	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We gave them $150 billion back.
1133	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.
1134	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, cash.
1135	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.
1136	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We gave them $1.7 billion.
1137	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.
1138	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.
1139	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't know who the rebels are.
1140	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.
1141	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't know who the rebels are.
1142	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.
1143	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.
1144	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.
1145	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...
1146	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me...
1147	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.
1148	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.
1149	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lots of luck, Hillary.
1150	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.
1151	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.
1152	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.
1153	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia.
1154	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?
1155	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?
1156	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.
1157	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.
1158	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This would not be done just on the first day.
1159	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This would take a lot of negotiation.
1160	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.
1161	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.
1162	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.
1163	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.
1164	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's made these claims repeatedly.
1165	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.
1166	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.
1167	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.
1168	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.
1169	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.
1170	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.
1171	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.
1172	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.
1173	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Folks, I want to get into our final segment.
1174	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I just have to...
1175	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Real quick.
1176	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.
1177	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.
1178	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And right now, they're in 32 countries.
1179	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
1180	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should have -- wait one second.
1181	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.
1182	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.
1183	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.
1184	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.
1185	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are outplayed.
1186	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, she wasn't there.
1187	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I assume she had nothing to do with it.
1188	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.
1189	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.
1190	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.
1191	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.
1192	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the highest since just after World War II.
1193	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.
1194	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.
1195	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?
1196	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you go first.
1197	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.
1198	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.
1199	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.
1200	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.
1201	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.
1202	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.
1203	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.
1204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To do that, we're taking back jobs.
1205	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.
1206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's very sad.
1207	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.
1208	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We used to be there.
1209	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've given it up.
1210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've become very, very sloppy.
1211	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.
1212	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.
1213	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we don't use those people.
1214	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.
1215	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.
1216	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.
1217	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We use political hacks.
1218	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.
1219	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have to use our great people.
1220	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.
1221	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.
1222	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.
1223	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
1224	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great.
1225	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.
1226	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.
1227	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was criticizing President Reagan.
1228	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.
1229	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.
1230	CLINTON	7	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	I do not add a penny to the national debt.
1231	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.
1232	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.
1233	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.
1234	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.
1235	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, I think just the opposite.
1236	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.
1237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.
1238	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's where growth will come from.
1239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I want to invest in you.
1240	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to invest in your family.
1241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.
1242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we just have a big disagreement about this.
1243	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It may be because of our experiences.
1244	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...
1245	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.
1246	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.
1247	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've heard this before.
1248	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.
1249	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Time.
1250	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Hillary.
1251	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Could I just respond?
1252	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...
1253	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.
1254	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I disagreed with him.
1255	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.
1256	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've been waiting for years.
1257	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody does it right.
1258	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
1259	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And frankly, now we're going to do it right.
1260	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
1261	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.
1262	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.
1263	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?
1264	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm cutting taxes.
1265	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to grow the economy.
1266	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.
1267	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not going to help in the entitlements.
1268	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, it's going to totally help you.
1269	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
1270	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	It's destroying our country.
1271	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.
1272	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
1273	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.
1274	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.
1275	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Obamacare has to go.
1276	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.
1277	TRUMP	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.
1278	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.
1279	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bad health care at the most expensive price.
1280	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
1281	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.
1282	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?
1283	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.
1284	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.
1285	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.
1286	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...
1287	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Such a nasty woman.
1288	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.
1289	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will not cut benefits.
1290	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.
1291	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.
1292	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.
1293	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.
1294	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.
1295	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.
1296	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What we need to do is go after...
1297	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Your husband disagrees with you.
1298	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... the long-term health care drivers.
1299	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.
1300	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a plan for doing that.
1301	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.
1302	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign.
1303	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like to end it on a positive note.
1304	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.
1305	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president.
1306	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is another new mini-segment.
1307	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.
1308	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.
1309	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.
1310	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.
1311	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.
1312	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.
1313	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.
1314	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.
1315	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.
1316	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.
1317	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
1318	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
1319	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.
1320	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Doesn't work that way.
1321	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.
1322	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's called "Make America Great Again."
1323	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to make America great.
1324	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a depleted military.
1325	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.
1326	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.
1327	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We don't take care of our veterans.
1328	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.
1329	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That can't happen.
1330	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our policemen and women are disrespected.
1331	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need law and order, but we need justice, too.
1332	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	Our inner cities are a disaster.
1333	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	You get shot walking to the store.
1334	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	They have no education.
1335	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	They have no jobs.
1336	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.
1337	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.
1338	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.
1339	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.
1340	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you both.
1341	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1342	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks.
1343	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.
1344	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
1345	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us.
1346	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now the decision is up to you.
1347	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away.
1348	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote.
1349	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.
1350	WALLACE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, and good night.
