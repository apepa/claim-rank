1	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
2	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much for being here.
3	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.
4	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.
5	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.
6	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.
7	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Patrice?
8	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, and good evening.
9	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.
10	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?
11	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, thank you.
12	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you a teacher?
13	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.
14	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.
15	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.
16	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.
17	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.
18	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."
19	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.
20	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.
21	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.
22	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.
23	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.
24	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
25	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
26	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I actually agree with that.
27	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I agree with everything she said.
28	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.
29	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a great country.
30	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a great land.
31	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.
32	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.
33	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And my whole concept was to make America great again.
34	TRUMP	7	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.
35	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.
36	TRUMP	6	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.
37	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In other words, trading with other countries.
38	TRUMP	5	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	We had an $800 billion deficit.
39	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's hard to believe.
40	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Inconceivable.
41	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You say who's making these deals?
42	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going the make great deals.
43	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have a strong border.
44	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to bring back law and order.
45	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.
46	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And this is happening on a weekly basis.
47	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.
48	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.
49	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need justice.
50	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.
51	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's called make America great again.
52	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
53	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?
54	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine.
55	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You called what you said locker room banter.
56	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.
57	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is sexual assault.
58	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.
59	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you understand that?
60	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	No, I didn't say that at all.
61	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.
62	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not proud of it.
63	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I apologize to my family.
64	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I apologize to the American people.
65	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Certainly I'm not proud of it.
66	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But this is locker room talk.
67	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.
68	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.
69	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they look and they see.
70	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?
71	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they look at our country and they see what's going on.
72	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.
73	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hate it.
74	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.
75	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will knock the hell out of ISIS.
76	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to defeat ISIS.
77	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.
78	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.
79	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Mr. Trump...
80	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
81	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?
82	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have great respect for women.
83	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
84	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?
85	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.
86	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was embarrassed by it.
87	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I have tremendous respect for women.
88	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Have you ever done those things?
89	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And women have respect for me.
90	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you: No, I have not.
91	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.
92	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.
93	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.
94	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to make America safe again.
95	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.
96	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.
97	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
98	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.
99	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
100	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what I want to talk about.
101	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?
102	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.
103	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.
104	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump is different.
105	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.
106	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.
107	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.
108	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
109	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
110	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.
111	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have seen him insult women.
112	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.
113	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.
114	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.
115	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.
116	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
117	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So this is who Donald Trump is.
118	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.
119	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.
120	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.
121	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
122	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we want to get to some questions from online...
123	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Am I allowed to respond to that?
124	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I assume I am.
125	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, you can respond to that.
126	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's just words, folks.
127	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's just words.
128	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.
129	TRUMP	3	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.
130	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.
131	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to help the African-Americans.
132	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.
133	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am going to help the inner cities.
134	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.
135	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.
136	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.
137	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...
138	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.
139	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?
140	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.
141	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sounds fair.
142	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This tape is generating intense interest.
143	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.
144	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.
145	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him."
146	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"When did that happen?"""
147	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.
148	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?
149	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you have two minutes for this.
150	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was locker room talk, as I told you.
151	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was locker room talk.
152	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not proud of it.
153	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.
154	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.
155	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that was something that happened.
156	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
157	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Mine are words, and his was action.
158	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	His was what he's done to women.
159	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
160	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
161	TRUMP	6	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
162	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Four of them here tonight.
163	TRUMP	4	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.
164	TRUMP	7	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
165	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.
166	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So don't tell me about words.
167	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.
168	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it is things that people say.
169	TRUMP	5	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.
170	TRUMP	5	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.
171	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
172	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.
173	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
174	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can we please hold the applause?
175	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
176	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
177	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.
178	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.
179	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.
180	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
181	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	 And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.
182	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.
183	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.
184	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.
185	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""
186	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.
187	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.
188	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.
189	TRUMP	8	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.
190	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you really owe him an apology.
191	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.
192	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.
193	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Number two, Michelle Obama.
194	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.
195	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.
196	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, you talk about friend?
197	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.
198	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.
199	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.
200	TRUMP	4	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.
201	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll tell you what.
202	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.
203	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.
204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.
205	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.
206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.
207	TRUMP	5	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.
208	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?
209	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.
210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's a disgrace.
211	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
212	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.
213	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
214	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.
215	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.
216	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, really?
217	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the first debate...
218	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
219	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And really, the audience needs to calm down here.
220	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.
221	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.
222	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.
223	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.
224	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
225	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because you'd be in jail.
226	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
227	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
228	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.
229	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please do not applaud.
230	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're just wasting time.
231	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.
232	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.
233	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."""
234	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.
235	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't call that extremely careless?
236	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.
237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.
238	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not making any excuses.
239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a mistake.
240	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I am very sorry about that.
241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.
242	CLINTON	6	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.
243	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I take classified materials very seriously and always have.
244	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.
245	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.
246	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.
247	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.
248	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, we're going to move on.
249	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.
250	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right?
251	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.
252	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, it's amazing.
253	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.
254	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.
255	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?
256	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think so.
257	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.
258	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.
259	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.
260	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.
261	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That wasn't before.
262	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was after.
263	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She got it from the United States Congress.
264	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.
265	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.
266	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.
267	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
268	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to move on.
269	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You did that.
270	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wait a minute.
271	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One second.
272	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.
273	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to give the audience a chance.
274	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
275	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you can respond.
276	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then we have to move on to an audience question.
277	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, it's just not true.
278	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so please, go to...
279	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, you didn't delete them?
280	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Allow her to respond, please.
281	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was personal e-mails, not official.
282	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, 33,000?
283	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah.
284	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...
285	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, yeah.
286	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What about the other 15,000?
287	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please allow her to respond.
288	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She didn't talk while you talked.
289	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, that's true, I didn't.
290	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because you have nothing to say.
291	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.
292	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Get off this question.
293	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, Donald.
294	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.
295	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let's at least focus...
296	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's see what happens...
297	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
298	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Allow her to respond.
299	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	on some of the issues that people care about tonight.
300	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's get to their questions.
301	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.
302	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has a question about health care.
303	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ken?
304	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?
305	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to know.
306	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why aren't you bringing...
307	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We brought up the e-mails.
308	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, it hasn't.
309	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It hasn't.
310	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it hasn't been finished at all.
311	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ken Karpowicz has a question.
312	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's nice to -- one on three.
313	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
314	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.
315	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Premiums have gone up.
316	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Deductibles have gone up.
317	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Copays have gone up.
318	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Prescriptions have gone up.
319	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the coverage has gone down.
320	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?
321	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.
322	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If he wants to start, he can start.
323	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, go ahead, Donald.
324	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.
325	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead.
326	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
327	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
328	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.
329	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.
330	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Premiums have gotten too high.
331	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.
332	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.
333	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that in and of itself was a good thing.
334	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.
335	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.
336	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
337	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.
338	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.
339	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.
340	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.
341	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we've got to get costs down.
342	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.
343	CLINTON	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.
344	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then we would have to start all over again.
345	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.
346	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.
347	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, your time is up.
348	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.
349	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
350	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.
351	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Obamacare is a disaster.
352	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know it.
353	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We all know it.
354	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.
355	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.
356	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's only getting worse.
357	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In '17, it implodes by itself.
358	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.
359	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.
360	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obamacare will never work.
361	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.
362	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Far too expensive.
363	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.
364	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
365	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.
366	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.
367	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want competition.
368	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You will have the finest health care plan there is.
369	TRUMP	9	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.
370	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.
371	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's catastrophic in certain ways.
372	TRUMP	4	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.
373	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.
374	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obamacare was the first step.
375	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obamacare is a total disaster.
376	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.
377	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, your time...
378	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.
379	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.
380	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half."
381	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?
382	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.
383	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's very clear.
384	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.
385	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we have an employer-based system.
386	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.
387	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.
388	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.
389	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.
390	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.
391	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...
392	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
393	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...
394	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your time is up.
395	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.
396	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.
397	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not going to work.
398	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.
399	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I just want -- just one thing.
400	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.
401	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everything.
402	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.
403	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.
404	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've said you want to end Obamacare...
405	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By the way...
406	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've said you want to end Obamacare.
407	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.
408	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?
409	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to be able to.
410	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're going to have plans...
411	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What does that mean?
412	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'll tell you what it means.
413	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.
414	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...
415	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?
416	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.
417	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.
418	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.
419	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.
420	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.
421	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.
422	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.
423	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to block grant into the states.
424	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...
425	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
426	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
427	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
428	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.
429	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hi.
430	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.
431	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?
432	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you're first.
433	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.
434	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.
435	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.
436	TRUMP	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.
437	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.
438	TRUMP	8	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.
439	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Horribly wounded.
440	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They'll never be the same.
441	TRUMP	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.
442	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.
443	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.
444	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go outside.
445	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look at Paris.
446	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.
447	TRUMP	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.
448	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""
449	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.
450	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.
451	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the name is there.
452	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's radical Islamic terror.
453	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And before you solve it, you have to say the name.
454	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
455	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, thank you for asking your question.
456	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.
457	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.
458	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to say just a couple of things.
459	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.
460	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we've had many successful Muslims.
461	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.
462	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.
463	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what America is.
464	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.
465	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.
466	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.
467	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.
468	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.
469	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.
470	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?
471	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.
472	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are not at war with Islam.
473	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.
474	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.
475	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
476	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, in December, you said this.
477	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
478	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have no choice.
479	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have no choice.
480	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.
481	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Is that correct?
482	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?
483	TRUMP	5	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.
484	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iraq was disaster.
485	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So he would have been alive today.
486	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.
487	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.
488	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me..
489	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And why did it morph into that?
490	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, did you -- no, answer the question.
491	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you still believe...
492	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why don't you interrupt her?
493	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You interrupt me all the time.
494	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do.
495	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why don't you interrupt her?
496	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?
497	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's called extreme vetting.
498	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.
499	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.
500	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.
501	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
502	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have enough problems in this country.
503	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe in building safe zones.
504	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.
505	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.
506	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.
507	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.
508	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We know you want tougher vetting.
509	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not a perfect system.
510	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?
511	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.
512	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.
513	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.
514	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we need to do our part.
515	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.
516	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.
517	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.
518	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you do that?
519	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.
520	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?
521	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?
522	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?
523	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.
524	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.
525	CLINTON	3	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.
526	CLINTON	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	We have it on tape.
527	CLINTON	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The entire press corps has looked at it.
528	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.
529	TRUMP	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	That's not been debunked.
530	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, please...
531	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	That has not been debunked.
532	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.
533	TRUMP	8	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.
534	TRUMP	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	Has not been debunked.
535	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you voted for it.
536	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you shouldn't have.
537	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I just want to say...
538	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's been lots of fact-checking on that.
539	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to move on to an online question...
540	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me.
541	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
542	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She did not.
543	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Could I just respond to this, please?
544	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very quickly, please.
545	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.
546	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.
547	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.
548	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And they don't want them.
549	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.
550	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.
551	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're murderers and some very bad people.
552	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.
553	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.
554	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	At a record clip.
555	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
556	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	ICE just endorsed me.
557	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.
558	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.
559	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't.
560	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	She wants amnesty for everybody.
561	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Come right in.
562	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Come right over.
563	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a horrible thing she's doing.
564	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.
565	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That I can tell you.
566	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
567	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to move on.
568	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes.
569	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.
570	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?
571	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?
572	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.
573	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, right.
574	CLINTON	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""
575	CLINTON	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.
576	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was principled, and it was strategic.
577	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.
578	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.
579	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.
580	CLINTON	5	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.
581	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.
582	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.
583	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.
584	CLINTON	5	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.
585	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.
586	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we deserve answers.
587	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...
588	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to get to that later.
589	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you're out of time.
590	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	with the Russians and other foreign powers.
591	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
592	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.
593	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.
594	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.
595	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she lied.
596	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.
597	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's one that I haven't...
598	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
599	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.
600	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the good thing.
601	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.
602	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's a big, big difference.
603	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're talking about some difference.
604	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.
605	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.
606	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	But I don't know Putin.
607	TRUMP	4	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.
608	TRUMP	4	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	Maybe there is no hacking.
609	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they always blame Russia.
610	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.
611	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I know nothing about Russia.
612	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.
613	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't deal there.
614	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have no businesses there.
615	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I have no loans from Russia.
616	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.
617	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.
618	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I have no loans with Russia.
619	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.
620	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.
621	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
622	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.
623	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.
624	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.
625	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.
626	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
627	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.
628	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll be very proud to.
629	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're actually quite great.
630	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
631	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes.
632	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a question from Spencer Maass.
633	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Spencer?
634	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good evening.
635	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?
636	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
637	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.
638	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.
639	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.
640	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.
641	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.
642	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, why didn't she change it?
643	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?
644	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.
645	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I do.
646	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.
647	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.
648	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.
649	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.
650	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I wish you would have done this.
651	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.
652	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She never changed.
653	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she never will change.
654	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She never will change.
655	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.
656	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.
657	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.
658	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.
659	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We're cutting taxes for the middle class.
660	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.
661	TRUMP	6	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.
662	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can look at me.
663	TRUMP	5	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	She's raising your taxes really high.
664	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.
665	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.
666	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That in itself is a big difference.
667	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to be thriving again.
668	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We have no growth in this country.
669	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	There's no growth.
670	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.
671	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We're down at 1 percent.
672	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's, like, no growth.
673	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going lower, in my opinion.
674	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.
675	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.
676	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.
677	TRUMP	5	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
678	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
679	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?
680	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.
681	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.
682	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.
683	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.
684	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.
685	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.
686	CLINTON	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.
687	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, here's what I want to do.
688	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.
689	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.
690	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.
691	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.
692	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.
693	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's called the Buffett rule.
694	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.
695	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.
696	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.
697	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to invest in hard-working families.
698	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.
699	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we need to reverse that.
700	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.
701	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
702	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.
703	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
704	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.
705	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.
706	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.
707	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.
708	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.
709	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.
710	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have not answered, though, a simple question.
711	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?
712	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course I do.
713	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course I do.
714	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.
715	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know many of her donors.
716	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.
717	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?
718	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.
719	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.
720	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why.
721	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.
722	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.
723	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.
724	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.
725	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.
726	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I absolutely used it.
727	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.
728	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.
729	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we won't make them famous.
730	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?
731	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.
732	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.
733	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I love depreciation.
734	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, she's given it to us.
735	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.
736	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I say it all the time.
737	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She talks about health care.
738	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why didn't she do something about it?
739	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She talks about taxes.
740	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why didn't she do something about it?
741	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.
742	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	With her, it's all talk and no action.
743	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the past...
744	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.
745	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.
746	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.
747	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.
748	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.
749	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Congratulations.
750	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Great job.
751	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.
752	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, here we go again.
753	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.
754	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that's not the point here.
755	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why didn't you do it?
756	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why didn't you do it?
757	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Allow her to respond.
758	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.
759	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, really?
760	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will be the president and we will get it done.
761	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's exactly right.
762	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.
763	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.
764	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you were not an effective senator.
765	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please allow her to respond.
766	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She didn't interrupt you.
767	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.
768	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""
769	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.
770	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm very glad to do so.
771	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.
772	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.
773	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.
774	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.
775	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.
776	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.
777	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.
778	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.
779	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, secretary.
780	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.
781	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, secretary.
782	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to move on to Syria.
783	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Both of you have mentioned that.
784	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said a lot of things that were false.
785	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...
786	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.
787	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is about the audience.
788	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me.
789	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.
790	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A disaster.
791	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.
792	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.
793	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.
794	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.
795	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.
796	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
797	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?
798	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.
799	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.
800	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.
801	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.
802	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.
803	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.
804	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.
805	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.
806	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.
807	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.
808	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.
809	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.
810	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've stood up to Russia.
811	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.
812	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.
813	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I did as secretary of state.
814	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.
815	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.
816	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.
817	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.
818	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
819	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
820	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...
821	CLINTON	4	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	No, I wasn't.
822	CLINTON	4	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	I was gone.
823	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...
824	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
825	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you were in contact -- excuse me.
826	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were...
827	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.
828	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.
829	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.
830	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Obama draws the line in the sand.
831	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.
832	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.
833	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.
834	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not good.
835	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.
836	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Russia is new in terms of nuclear.
837	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are old.
838	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're tired.
839	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.
840	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A very bad thing.
841	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.
842	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She talks in favor of the rebels.
843	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't even know who the rebels are.
844	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.
845	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know what happens?
846	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They end up being worse than the people.
847	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.
848	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gadhafi's out.
849	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a mess.
850	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.
851	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm sure you probably have heard that.
852	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a disaster.
853	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
854	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.
855	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We sign a peace treaty.
856	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everyone's all excited.
857	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.
858	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But look at that deal.
859	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Iran now and Russia are now against us.
860	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So she wants to fight.
861	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She wants to fight for rebels.
862	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's only one problem.
863	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't even know who the rebels are.
864	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So what's the purpose?
865	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.
866	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And one thing I have to say.
867	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes is up.
868	TRUMP	5	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.
869	TRUMP	5	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	Russia is killing ISIS.
870	TRUMP	4	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	And Iran is killing ISIS.
871	TRUMP	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
872	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.
873	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you were president...
874	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
875	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
876	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to remind you what your running mate said.
877	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.
878	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
879	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.
880	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I disagree.
881	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You disagree with your running mate?
882	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you have to knock out ISIS.
883	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.
884	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.
885	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Syria is no longer Syria.
886	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.
887	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe we have to get ISIS.
888	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.
889	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She had a chance to do something with Syria.
890	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They had a chance.
891	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that was the line.
892	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she didn't.
893	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
894	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.
895	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What do you think will happen if it falls?
896	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I think that it basically has fallen.
897	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK?
898	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It basically has fallen.
899	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you something.
900	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You take a look at Mosul.
901	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.
902	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.
903	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.
904	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.
905	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why can't they do it quietly?
906	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?
907	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People leave.
908	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?
909	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How stupid is our country?
910	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are sometimes reasons the military does that.
911	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Psychological warfare.
912	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can't think of any.
913	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can't think of any.
914	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm pretty good at it.
915	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It might be to help get civilians out.
916	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have General Flynn.
917	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.
918	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.
919	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We talk about it all the time.
920	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?
921	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How -- why would these people stay there?
922	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've been reading now...
923	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tell me what your strategy is.
924	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.
925	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.
926	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're gone.
927	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.
928	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.
929	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All I say is this.
930	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.
931	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.
932	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.
933	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.
934	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You talk about diplomatic efforts.
935	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those have failed.
936	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Cease-fires have failed.
937	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?
938	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would not use American ground forces in Syria.
939	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that would be a very serious mistake.
940	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.
941	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think that is a smart strategy.
942	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...
943	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?
944	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...
945	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everything.
946	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.
947	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.
948	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.
949	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, he doesn't.
950	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.
951	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.
952	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would go after Baghdadi.
953	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.
954	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think that could help.
955	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would also consider arming the Kurds.
956	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.
957	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.
958	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much.
959	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to move on...
960	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know what's funny?
961	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.
962	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.
963	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You had many answers.
964	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's really -- it's really very interesting.
965	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got a question over here from James Carter.
966	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Carter?
967	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?
968	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That question begins for Mr. Trump.
969	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely.
970	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.
971	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will be a president for all of our people.
972	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.
973	TRUMP	5	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.
974	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not in this country.
975	TRUMP	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.
976	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	We lost our jobs.
977	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	We lost our money.
978	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	We lost our plants.
979	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is a disaster.
980	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.
981	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	She called it the gold standard.
982	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.
983	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They actually said that she lied.
984	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK?
985	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And she lied.
986	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she's lied about a lot of things.
987	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.
988	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.
989	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's been talking about it for years.
990	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.
991	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't get it done.
992	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.
993	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The same exact thing.
994	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They talk, they don't get it done.
995	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.
996	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.
997	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The education is a disaster.
998	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Jobs are essentially nonexistent.
999	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?
1000	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It can't get any worse.
1001	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.
1002	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nothing's going to ever happen.
1003	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.
1004	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's just going to be talk.
1005	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.
1006	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's not doing any me favors.
1007	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.
1008	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, thank you.
1009	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will tell you, she's all talk.
1010	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It doesn't get done.
1011	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.
1012	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Take a look at upstate New York.
1013	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes is up.
1014	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, two minutes?
1015	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It turned out to be a disaster.
1016	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
1017	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.
1018	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.
1019	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.
1020	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.
1021	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm proud of that.
1022	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.
1023	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.
1024	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.
1025	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.
1026	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.
1027	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.
1028	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.
1029	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's 10 years old now.
1030	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the only one country he's ever known.
1031	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?
1032	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, children listen to what is being said.
1033	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To go back to the very, very first question.
1034	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.
1035	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Bullying is up.
1036	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.
1037	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.
1038	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.
1039	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your time, Secretary Clinton.
1040	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.
1041	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.
1042	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes is up.
1043	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.
1044	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up.
1045	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month.
1046	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, ""deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic."""
1047	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You later said you regretted saying half.
1048	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"You didn't express regret for using the term ""deplorables."""
1049	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?
1050	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.
1051	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.
1052	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.
1053	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.
1054	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.
1055	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he is supporting me 100 percent.
1056	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1057	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.
1058	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...
1059	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
1060	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	but we believed that we could make the country better.
1061	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was proud of that.
1062	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to give you a minute to respond.
1063	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a divided nation.
1064	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a very divided nation.
1065	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You look at Charlotte.
1066	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You look at Baltimore.
1067	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.
1068	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.
1069	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.
1070	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when she said deplorables, she meant it.
1071	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.
1072	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said some of them are irredeemable.
1073	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.
1074	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.
1075	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you.
1076	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.
1077	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, ""he or she won't be one for very long."""
1078	COOPER	6	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.
1079	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Is that the discipline of a good leader?
1080	TRUMP	7	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.
1081	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
1082	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You mentioned sex tape.
1083	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.
1084	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?
1085	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Guess what?
1086	TRUMP	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...
1087	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?
1088	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.
1089	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.
1090	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she said she'll be awake.
1091	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.
1092	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Guess what happened?
1093	TRUMP	5	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.
1094	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.
1095	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.
1096	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.
1097	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, you can like it or not like it.
1098	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.
1099	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a very effective way of communication.
1100	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.
1101	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.
1102	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?
1103	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No.
1104	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm shocked to hear that.
1105	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
1106	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it's not only my opinion.
1107	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.
1108	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.
1109	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everybody.
1110	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.
1111	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.
1112	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He stuck with me.
1113	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have worked and I admire President Obama.
1114	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
1115	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was a terrible time for our country.
1116	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to move along.
1117	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nine million people lost their jobs.
1118	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, we have to...
1119	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Five million homes were lost.
1120	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, we're moving.
1121	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
1122	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are back on the right track.
1123	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.
1124	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question.
1125	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're almost out of time.
1126	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have another...
1127	TRUMP	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the slowest growth since 1929.
1128	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're moving to an audience question.
1129	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
1130	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience.
1131	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much both of you.
1132	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
1133	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have another audience question.
1134	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.
1135	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good evening.
1136	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.
1137	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?
1138	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
1139	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1140	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you're right.
1141	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is one of the most important issues in this election.
1142	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.
1143	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.
1144	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.
1145	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald doesn't agree with that.
1146	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.
1147	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.
1148	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.
1149	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.
1150	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.
1151	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.
1152	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.
1153	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.
1154	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.
1155	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that was a dereliction of duty.
1156	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.
1157	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
1158	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1159	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're out of time.
1160	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
1161	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.
1162	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have a vacancy.
1163	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.
1164	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.
1165	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.
1166	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that this is so important.
1167	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.
1168	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.
1169	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So important to me.
1170	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.
1171	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.
1172	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What I ask is this.
1173	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.
1174	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Pretty much self-funding money.
1175	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.
1176	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.
1177	TRUMP	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.
1178	TRUMP	2	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?
1179	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.
1180	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why aren't you putting some money in?
1181	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have a lot of it.
1182	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.
1183	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.
1184	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?
1185	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm just curious.
1186	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
1187	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1188	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much.
1189	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to get on to one more question.
1190	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question was about the Supreme Court.
1191	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.
1192	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.
1193	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1194	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.
1195	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
1196	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.
1197	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ken?
1198	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
1199	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, two minutes?
1200	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely.
1201	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.
1202	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Under absolutely siege.
1203	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.
1204	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.
1205	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.
1206	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.
1207	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we need much more than wind and solar.
1208	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you look at our miners.
1209	TRUMP	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.
1210	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There is a thing called clean coal.
1211	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.
1212	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.
1213	TRUMP	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.
1214	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So good.
1215	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.
1216	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will bring our energy companies back.
1217	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They'll be able to compete.
1218	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They'll make money.
1219	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They'll pay off our national debt.
1220	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.
1221	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.
1222	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to bring back our workers.
1223	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.
1224	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to guard our energy companies.
1225	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to make it possible.
1226	TRUMP	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.
1227	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.
1228	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a disgrace.
1229	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your time is up.
1230	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1231	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's an absolute disgrace.
1232	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, two minutes.
1233	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And actually -- well, that was very interesting.
1234	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.
1235	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.
1236	CLINTON	4	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.
1237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.
1238	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.
1239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the price of oil has been way down.
1240	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?
1241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.
1242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that's an important transition.
1243	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to remain energy-independent.
1244	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.
1245	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.
1246	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.
1247	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.
1248	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.
1249	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.
1250	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A lot of them lost their lives.
1251	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.
1252	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't want to walk away from them.
1253	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we've got to do something for them.
1254	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
1255	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But the price of coal is down worldwide.
1256	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have to look at this comprehensively.
1257	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your time is up.
1258	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's exactly what I have proposed.
1259	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.
1260	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Time is up.
1261	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have time for one more...
1262	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have...
1263	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One more audience question.
1264	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.
1265	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good evening.
1266	QUESTION	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?
1267	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1268	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?
1269	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.
1270	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, I respect his children.
1271	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.
1272	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.
1273	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.
1274	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.
1275	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.
1276	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.
1277	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
1278	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.
1279	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.
1280	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.
1281	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mr. Trump?
1282	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.
1283	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.
1284	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.
1285	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I consider that a compliment.
1286	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will say this about Hillary.
1287	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't quit.
1288	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She doesn't give up.
1289	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I respect that.
1290	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I tell it like it is.
1291	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's a fighter.
1292	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.
1293	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.
1294	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.
1295	TRUMP	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I consider that to be a very good trait.
1296	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thanks to both of you.
1297	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to thank both the candidates.
1298	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to thank the university here.
1299	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This concludes the town hall meeting.
1300	COOPER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.
1301	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
1302	RADDATZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good night, everyone.
