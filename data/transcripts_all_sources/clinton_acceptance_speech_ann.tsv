1	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you so much.
2	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
3	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you all so so much.
4	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
5	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
6	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you all very, very much.
7	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you for that amazing welcome.
8	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you all for the great convention that we've had.
9	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Chelsea, thank you.
10	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become.
11	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.
12	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago, it is still going strong.
13	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us.
14	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've even gotten a few words in along the way.
15	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my explainer-in-chief is still on the job.
16	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime.
17	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight, and to those of you who joined this campaign this week.
18	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
19	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What a remarkable week it's been.
20	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton.
21	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the man of Hope, Barack Obama.
22	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship.
23	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden.
24	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people, as only he can do.
25	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too.
26	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine — you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to governor, and now senator.
27	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he will make the whole country proud as our vice president.
28	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And ... I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
29	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Bernie, Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.
30	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.
31	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I've heard you.
32	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your cause is our cause.
33	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our country needs your ideas, energy and passion.
34	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America.
35	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We wrote it together — now let's go out and make it happen together.
36	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My friends, we've come to Philadelphia — the birthplace of our nation — because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today.
37	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We all know the story.
38	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we usually focus on how it turned out — and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.
39	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king.
40	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And some wanted to stick it to the king.
41	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The revolution hung in the balance.
42	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then somehow, they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose.
43	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation.
44	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what made it possible to stand up to a king.
45	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That took courage.
46	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They had courage.
47	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.
48	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, now America is once again at a moment of reckoning.
49	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart.
50	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bonds of trust and respect are fraying.
51	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees.
52	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It truly is up to us.
53	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together.
54	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Our country's motto is ""e pluribus unum"": out of many, we are one."
55	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Will we stay true to that motto?
56	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention.
57	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other.
58	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise.
59	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"He's taken the Republican Party a long way from ""Morning in America"" to ""Midnight in America."""
60	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.
61	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."""
62	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against.
63	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we are not afraid.
64	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have.
65	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	We will not build a wall.
66	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one.
67	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy!
68	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We, we will not ban a religion.
69	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.
70	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's a lot of work to do.
71	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash.
72	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's too much inequality.
73	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too little social mobility.
74	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too much paralysis in Washington.
75	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too many threats at home and abroad.
76	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges.
77	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.
78	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had.
79	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the most powerful military.
80	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most innovative entrepreneurs.
81	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most enduring values: freedom and equality, justice and opportunity.
82	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should be so proud that those words are associated with us.
83	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I have to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries.
84	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When people hear those words, they hear America.
85	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak.
86	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're not.
87	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes.
88	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We do.
89	CLINTON	4	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	"And most of all, don't believe anyone who says, ""I alone can fix it."""
90	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	Yes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland.
91	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.
92	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Really? 
93	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I alone can fix it? 
94	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Isn't he forgetting?
95	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Troops on the front lines.
96	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger.
97	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Doctors and nurses who care for us.
98	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Teachers who change lives.
99	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem.
100	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.
101	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's forgetting every last one of us.
102	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Americans don't say, ""I alone can fix it."" We say, ""We'll fix it together."""
103	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And remember, remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.
104	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Two-hundred-and-forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.
105	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers.
106	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them.
107	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know how the community responded? 
108	CLINTON	4	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.
109	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.
110	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Twenty years ago, I wrote a book called It Takes a Village.
111	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, ""What the heck do you mean by that?"""
112	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is what I mean.
113	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.
114	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.
115	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe that with all my heart.
116	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"That's why ""Stronger Together"" is not just a lesson from our history."
117	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not just a slogan for our campaign.
118	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build.
119	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.
120	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in.
121	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach.
122	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, where love trumps hate.
123	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the country we're fighting for.
124	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the future we're working toward.
125	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!
126	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, sometimes, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.
127	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As you know, I'm not one of those people.
128	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've been your First Lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York.
129	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then I represented all of you as secretary of state.
130	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But my job titles only tell you what I've done.
131	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They don't tell you why.
132	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ""service"" part has always come easier to me than the ""public"" part."
133	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.
134	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let me tell you.
135	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings.
136	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My family were builders of a different kind.
137	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Builders in the way most American families are.
138	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They used whatever tools they had — whatever God gave them — and whatever life in America provided — and built better lives and better futures for their kids.
139	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.
140	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did.
141	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he was right.
142	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	My dad, Hugh, made it to college.
143	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.
144	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	When the war was over, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.
145	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.
146	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had.
147	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he did.
148	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl.
149	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	She ended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid.
150	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was saved by the kindness of others.
151	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year.
152	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone.
153	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
154	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: ""Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can."""
155	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.
156	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house.
157	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She told me how badly she wanted to go to school — it just didn't seem possible in those days.
158	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child.
159	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough.
160	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.
161	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You need both understanding and action.
162	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we gathered facts.
163	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	We built a coalition.
164	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.
165	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a big idea, isn't it? 
166	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.
167	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But how, how do you make an idea like that real? 
168	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You do it step-by-step, year-by-year, sometimes even door-by-door.
169	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage — because we changed our law to make sure she got an education.
170	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So it's true.
171	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I sweat the details of policy — whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Mich., the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.
172	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid — if it's your family.
173	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a big deal.
174	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it should be a big deal to your president, too.
175	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me.
176	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.
177	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning.
178	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They told their stories Tuesday night.
179	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I first met Ryan as a 7-year-old.
180	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds, because I leaned over to lift him up.
181	CLINTON	3	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country.
182	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11.
183	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero.
184	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.
185	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change.
186	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.
187	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you heard, you heard from, from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign.
188	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't.
189	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For all Americans together.
190	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Tonight, tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president.
191	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Standing here, standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come.
192	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.
193	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm happy for boys and men, too — because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone.
194	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.
195	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's keep going, let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have.
196	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.
197	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.
198	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.
199	CLINTON	8	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office.
200	CLINTON	9	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs.
201	CLINTON	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	Twenty million more Americans with health insurance.
202	CLINTON	6	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	And an auto industry that just had its best year ever.
203	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo.
204	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not by a long shot.
205	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.
206	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've gone around our country talking to working families.
207	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them.
208	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some of you are frustrated — even furious.
209	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know what? 
210	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're right.
211	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not yet working the way it should.
212	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Americans are willing to work — and work hard.
213	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do.
214	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And less respect for them, period.
215	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Democrats, we are the party of working people.
216	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help.
217	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.
218	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States.
219	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.
220	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country.
221	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.
222	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And here's what I believe.
223	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.
224	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.
225	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.
226	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.
227	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return.
228	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Many of them are.
229	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But too many aren't.
230	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.
231	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
232	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I believe in science.
233	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.
234	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.
235	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together — and it's the right thing to do.
236	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So, whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.
237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.
238	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us.
239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us.
240	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"If you believe that we should say ""no"" to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, then join us."
241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us.
242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us.
243	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's how we're going to sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.
244	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention.
245	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He spoke for 70-odd minutes — and I do mean odd.
246	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And he offered zero solutions.
247	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we already know he doesn't believe these things.
248	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans.
249	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.
250	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In my first hundred days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.
251	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.
252	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.
253	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.
254	CLINTON	3	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!
255	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will also, we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.
256	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, and students and families can't refinance their debts.
257	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And something we don't say often enough: Sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.
258	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.
259	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will give small businesses like my dad's a boost.
260	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Make it easier to get credit.
261	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.
262	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.
263	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we will help you balance family and work.
264	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the ""woman card,"" then deal me in."
265	CLINTON	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Now, here's the other thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them.
266	CLINTON	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.
267	CLINTON	7	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	This is not because we resent success, because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is, and we are going to follow the money.
268	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back.
269	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home!
270	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good.
271	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But how are you going to get it done? 
272	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?
273	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look at my record.
274	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people.
275	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as president.
276	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman.
277	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He must know something about the economy.
278	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let's take a closer look.
279	CLINTON	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.
280	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	"Now, remember what the president said last night: ""Don't boo, vote."" "
281	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it — not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them.
282	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	He just stiffed them.
283	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president? 
284	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Put your faith in him — and you'll win big? 
285	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses.
286	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.
287	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He also talks a big game about putting America first.
288	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	"Well, please explain what part of ""America First"" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado."
289	CLINTON	5	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan.
290	CLINTON	5	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio.
291	CLINTON	5	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.
292	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again — well, he could start by actually making things in America again.
293	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.
294	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, anyone, anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.
295	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.
296	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance.
297	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home.
298	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority.
299	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot — now we have to enforce it.
300	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And we must keep supporting Israel's security.
301	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement — now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.
302	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.
303	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS.
304	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground.
305	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen.
306	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.
307	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake — we will prevail.
308	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	"Now Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" "
309	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, Donald, you don't.
310	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	"He thinks, he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are ""a disaster."""
311	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is.
312	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our military is a national treasure.
313	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death.
314	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country — including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.
315	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So just ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief?
316	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign.
317	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He loses his cool at the slightest provocation.
318	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter.
319	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When he's challenged in a debate.
320	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When he sees a protester at a rally.
321	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.
322	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.
323	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can't put it, I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.
324	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men — the ones moved by fear and pride.
325	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America's strength doesn't come from lashing out.
326	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.
327	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be.
328	CLINTON	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.
329	CLINTON	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment.
330	CLINTON	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not here to take away your guns.
331	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.
332	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.
333	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, for decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch.
334	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing?
335	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage.
336	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.
337	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here.
338	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to heal the divides in our country.
339	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not just on guns.
340	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But on race.
341	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Immigration.
342	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And more.
343	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that starts with listening, listening to each other.
344	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes.
345	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.
346	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.
347	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
348	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we will defend, we will defend all our rights — civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!
349	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.
350	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments — excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.
351	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"They thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says — like when he called women ""pigs."" "
352	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage.
353	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.
354	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain — a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.
355	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either.
356	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was just too hard to fathom — that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things.
357	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Could be like that.
358	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump.
359	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is it.
360	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great — because America is good.
361	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So enough with the bigotry and bombast.
362	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump's not offering real change.
363	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's offering empty promises.
364	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what are we offering? 
365	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country — to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.
366	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The choice is clear, my friends.
367	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger.
368	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	None of us ever have or can do it alone.
369	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together.
370	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'm here to tell you tonight — progress is possible.
371	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know, I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.
372	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I know it, I know it from my own life.
373	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.
374	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother too.
375	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She never let me back down from any challenge.
376	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door."""
377	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Go back out there,"" she said."
378	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she was right.
379	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to stand up to bullies.
380	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.
381	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day.
382	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what.
383	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what we need to do together as a nation.
384	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Though ""we may not live to see the glory,"" as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, ""let us gladly join the fight."""
385	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Let our legacy be about ""planting seeds in a garden you never get to see."""
386	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why we're here ... not just in this hall, but on this Earth.
387	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Founders showed us that.
388	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so have many others since.
389	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.
390	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is the story of America.
391	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we begin a new chapter tonight.
392	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, the world is watching what we do.
393	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose.
394	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans.
395	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's look to the future with courage and confidence.
396	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.
397	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when we do, America will be greater than ever.
398	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!
