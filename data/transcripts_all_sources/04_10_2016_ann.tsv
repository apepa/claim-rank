0	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good evening.
1	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
2	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News.
3	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.
4	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.
5	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.
6	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.
7	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.
8	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.
9	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.
10	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.
11	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.
12	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
13	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen, welcome.
14	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.
15	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.
16	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.
17	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?
18	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
19	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome.
20	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.
21	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a very special place.
22	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School.
23	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She made history by protesting school segregation.
24	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She believed our nation was stronger together.
25	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.
26	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.
27	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.
28	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.
29	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.
30	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.
31	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.
32	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.
33	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've been a city councilman and mayor.
34	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.
35	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.
36	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government.
37	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.
38	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I relish that role.
39	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm so proud of her.
40	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll just say this:  We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life.
41	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.
42	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.
43	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
44	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.
45	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family.
46	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well.
47	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.
48	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened.
49	PENCE	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.
50	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.
51	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.
52	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville.
53	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.
54	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.
55	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.
56	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They built a family and -- and a good name and a business.
57	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they raised a family.
58	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.
59	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States.
60	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.
61	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy.
62	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why do so many people distrust her?
63	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?
64	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.
65	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.
66	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?
67	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?
68	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton has that passion.
69	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids.
70	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.
71	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.
72	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump always puts himself first.
73	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, "off the backs of the little guy."
74	KAINE	3	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.
75	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.
76	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish "me first" style of Donald Trump.
77	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, "thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."
78	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president.
79	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?
80	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign.
81	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It really is remarkable.
82	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.
83	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.
84	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...
85	KAINE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You guys love Russia.
86	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You both have said...
87	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... their heavy-handed approach.
88	KAINE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.
89	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
90	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
91	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment.
92	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I do want to get back to the question at...
93	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you.
94	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
95	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator, I'll...
96	KAINE	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
97	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How can that...
98	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
99	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, and we will get to that, Senator.
100	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We do have that coming up here.
101	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But in the meantime, the questions...
102	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Senator, I must have hit a...
103	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
104	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I must have hit a nerve here.
105	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why the disconnect?
106	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.
107	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times.
108	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	He's brought an extraordinary business acumen.
109	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.
110	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.
111	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
112	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And why the disconnect with your running mate?
113	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.
114	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's because they're paying attention.
115	PENCE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on.
116	PENCE	2	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.
117	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You are Donald Trump's apprentice.
118	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me talk about this...
119	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
120	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, I think I'm still on my time.
121	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?
122	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is our open discussion.
123	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, let's talk about the state of...
124	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
125	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.
126	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Finish your sentence.
127	PENCE	3	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.
128	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, now I can weigh in.
129	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now...
130	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She had a private server...
131	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I get to weigh in.
132	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, let me just say this...
133	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... that was discovered...
134	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
135	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.
136	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.
137	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.
138	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you?
139	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you this.
140	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?
141	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
142	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?
143	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?
144	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth.
145	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.
146	KAINE	6	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.
147	PENCE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?
148	KAINE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Absolutely, without firing a shot.
149	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.
150	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right and...
151	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are very, very good things.
152	PENCE	4	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...
153	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.
154	PENCE	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...
155	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, that is incorrect.
156	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's incorrect.
157	PENCE	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so we removed -- we removed all of our...
158	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen, we'll get to...
159	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
160	PENCE	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.
161	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'd like to correct...
162	PENCE	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and overrun vast areas of Iraq.
163	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.
164	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.
165	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	And guess what?
166	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.
167	PENCE	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	It was a failure of the secretary of state...
168	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.
169	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...
170	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.
171	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's turn to the issue of the economy.
172	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
173	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.
174	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, your plans would add even more to it.
175	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.
176	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.
177	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
178	PENCE	3	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.
179	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.
180	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.
181	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.
182	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.
183	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.
184	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.
185	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.
186	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.
187	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.
188	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.
189	PENCE	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.
190	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.
191	PENCE	3	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	They want to expand it into a single-payer program.
192	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.
193	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.
194	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can get America moving again.
195	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.
196	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.
197	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.
198	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
199	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.
200	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you want a "you're hired" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a "you're fired" president in Donald Trump?
201	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that's not such a hard choice.
202	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a "you're hired" plan.
203	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Five components.
204	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.
205	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.
206	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.
207	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.
208	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.
209	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.
210	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.
211	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Trump plan is a different plan.
212	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a "you're fired" plan.
213	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there's two key elements to it.
214	KAINE	4	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.
215	KAINE	3	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.
216	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.
217	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.
218	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.
219	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.
220	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.
221	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.
222	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?
223	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because his tax plan basically helps him.
224	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.
225	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.
226	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
227	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Does that seem fair to you?
228	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the "you're hired," "you're fired" thing, Senator.
229	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You use that a whole lot.
230	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.
231	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.
232	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table.
233	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.
234	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're in the...
235	KAINE	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	Fifteen million new jobs?
236	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
237	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Fifteen million new jobs?
238	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor...
239	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
240	PENCE	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...
241	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the poverty level and the median income...
242	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	... stepped into the Oval Office.
243	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.
244	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different.
245	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different.
246	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, this economy is struggling.
247	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The answer to this economy is not more taxes.
248	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
249	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not more spending...
250	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
251	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
252	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely I will.
253	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
254	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine.
255	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician.
256	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He actually built a business.
257	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.
258	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss.
259	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.
260	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But why won't he release his tax returns?
261	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...
262	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do want to come back to that, but...
263	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used.
264	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he did it brilliantly.
265	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you know that?
266	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You haven't seen his tax returns.
267	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.
268	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How do you know that?
269	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.
270	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...
271	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, let me talk about something.
272	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.
273	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
274	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.
275	KAINE	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, "If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."
276	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's broken his first...
277	PENCE	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he will.
278	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's broken his first promise.
279	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second, he stood on the stage...
280	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He hasn't broken his promise.
281	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said he's...
282	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, "That makes me smart."
283	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So it's smart not to pay for our military?
284	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's smart not to pay for veterans?
285	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's smart not to pay for teachers?
286	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid.
287	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the last thing I'll say is this...
288	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?
289	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...
290	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do.
291	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.
292	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president.
293	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And he's breaking his promise.
294	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, I have to respond to this.
295	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You get very little time, 20 seconds.
296	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.
297	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor?
298	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.
299	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But he said he would release his tax returns.
300	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, Gentlemen...
301	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The American people can review that.
302	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...
303	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... I need to ask you about Social Security...
304	KAINE	6	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.
305	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	They're going to raise your taxes.
306	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	We're going to cut your taxes.
307	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen...
308	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you can't meet Nixon's standard...
309	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other.
310	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.
311	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
312	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're having fun up here.
313	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76.
314	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year.
315	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would your administration do to prevent this cut?
316	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done.
317	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty.
318	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.
319	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to keep it solvent.
320	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we will keep it solvent.
321	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.
322	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Here's what Hillary and I will not do.
323	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to make this very plain.
324	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.
325	KAINE	4	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.
326	KAINE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.
327	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it.
328	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security.
329	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.
330	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond.
331	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, thanks, Elaine.
332	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There they go again.
333	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK...
334	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go read -- go read the book.
335	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors.
336	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's it.
337	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go read the book.
338	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare.
339	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what this campaign is really about, Senator.
340	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out...
341	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But -- but you have a voting record, Governor.
342	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I get all of that.
343	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just, look...
344	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I...
345	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.
346	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.
347	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have to go back to.
348	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We...
349	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security.
350	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes.
351	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to...
352	KAINE	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	You're not going to cut taxes.
353	KAINE	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.
354	PENCE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.
355	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
356	PENCE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt.
357	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're going to face hard choices and...
358	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
359	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentleman, I want to move on now.
360	KAINE	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.
361	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
362	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me move on now...
363	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy.
364	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... to the issue of law enforcement and race relations.
365	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Law enforcement and race relations.
366	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, "We're asking cops to do too much in this country.
367	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve.
368	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."
369	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do we ask too much of police officers in this country?
370	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns?
371	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
372	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment.
373	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we put a lot on police shoulders.
374	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.
375	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.
376	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.
377	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.
378	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too.
379	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we did something we had really wanted to do.
380	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.
381	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.
382	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.
383	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.
384	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.
385	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.
386	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.
387	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.
388	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So here's what we'll do.
389	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll focus on community policing.
390	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.
391	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I'm a gun-owner.
392	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.
393	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.
394	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.
395	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu.
396	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor.
397	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He had survived the Holocaust.
398	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.
399	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence.
400	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.
401	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
402	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago.
403	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was my hero when I was growing up.
404	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago.
405	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side.
406	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Police officers are the best of us.
407	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day.
408	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea.
409	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's worked in the Hoosier state.
410	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we fully support that.
411	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.
412	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.
413	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They see his commitment to law and order.
414	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.
415	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that really has got to stop.
416	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.
417	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn.
418	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We -- we grieve with those who grieve.
419	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're saddened at the loss of life.
420	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.
421	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just think...
422	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can I -- can I explain...
423	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.
424	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.
425	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.
426	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement.
427	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you're afraid to have...
428	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not afraid to bring that up.
429	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it.
430	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking.
431	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We would agree this was a heartbreaking example.
432	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school.
433	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.
434	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked.
435	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The kids loved him.
436	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.
437	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.
438	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need criminal justice reform.
439	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, we do.
440	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.
441	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I just want to say, those who say that we should not...
442	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that's not what you're talking about.
443	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem...
444	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence...
445	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
446	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence...
447	PENCE	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?
448	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even...
449	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
450	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence, I have a question on that point.
451	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did not make that statement.
452	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I...
453	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor.
454	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.
455	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A U.S. senator.
456	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said, "I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."
457	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?
458	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend.
459	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally.
460	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it.
461	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act.
462	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice.
463	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement.
464	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...
465	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, can I...
466	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?
467	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Law enforcement in this country is a force for good.
468	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day.
469	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement.
470	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk.
471	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime...
472	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, let me -- let me...
473	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, the question is about Senator Scott.
474	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott?
475	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in.
476	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea.
477	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law.
478	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So there is a fundamental respect issue here.
479	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top.
480	KAINE	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.
481	KAINE	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.
482	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother.
483	KAINE	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican.
484	KAINE	3	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured.
485	KAINE	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	He said African-Americans are living in Hell.
486	KAINE	3	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.
487	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about.
488	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.
489	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
490	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration.
491	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported.
492	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes?
493	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
494	PENCE	2	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.
495	PENCE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've been talking it to death for 20 years.
496	PENCE	5	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.
497	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement.
498	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.
499	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas.
500	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.
501	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.
502	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor.
503	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
504	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's my time, Senator.
505	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is, in fact, the governor's time.
506	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I apologize.
507	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's your two minutes.
508	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I apologize.
509	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thanks.
510	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I forgive you.
511	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He says ours is an insult-driven campaign.
512	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did you all just hear that?
513	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ours is an insult-driven campaign?
514	PENCE	5	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.
515	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.
516	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, it's extraordinary.
517	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then she labeled one after another "ism" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all.
518	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean...
519	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor...
520	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...
521	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
522	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	.... calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.
523	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that.
524	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said she shouldn't have said half.
525	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.
526	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, that's right, so now we're even.
527	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah.
528	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
529	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...
530	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh...
531	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.
532	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She apologized for saying "half."
533	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor.
534	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is his two minutes, please.
535	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?
536	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell?
537	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?
538	KAINE	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.
539	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Immigration.
540	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's two plans on the table.
541	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform.
542	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump believes in deportation nation.
543	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've got to pick your choice.
544	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.
545	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's our proposal.
546	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents.
547	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.
548	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that.
549	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's another 4.5 million people.
550	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force.
551	KAINE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.
552	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I cannot believe...
553	PENCE	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	That's nonsense.
554	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's nonsense.
555	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.
556	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Senator, we have a deportation force.
557	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
558	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.
559	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you like the 16 million deportations?
560	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, that's -- that's nonsense.
561	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.
562	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's...
563	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
564	KAINE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.
565	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill.
566	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We all know the routine.
567	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's amnesty.
568	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.
569	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's how Washington always plays it.
570	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I...
571	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border...
572	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
573	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.
574	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, Mr. Trump has said...
575	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.
576	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.
577	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave?
578	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Would they be forcibly removed?
579	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security.
580	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It begins with border security.
581	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.
582	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens.
583	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement.
584	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities.
585	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity.
586	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.
587	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas.
588	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to enforce the law of this country.
589	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that.
590	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...
591	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just have to correct Governor Pence....
592	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... where people can come into this country.
593	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have to...
594	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the order that you should do it.
595	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.
596	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in.
597	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said.
598	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.
599	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	He said, quote, "They will all be gone."
600	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They will all be gone.
601	KAINE	2	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said.
602	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And to add...
603	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's talking about criminal aliens.
604	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants.
605	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families.
606	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger.
607	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.
608	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism.
609	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?
610	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?
611	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
612	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead.
613	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped.
614	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world.
615	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's only 15,000.
616	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there are other parts of the world that are challenging.
617	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton.
618	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11.
619	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors.
620	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.
621	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she's got a plan to do it.
622	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden.
623	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Here's her plan to defeat ISIL.
624	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield.
625	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.
626	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens.
627	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence.
628	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.
629	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump.
630	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot.
631	KAINE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.
632	KAINE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	He said, "I have a secret plan," and then he said, "Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."
633	KAINE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And then he said, "I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."
634	KAINE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And finally he said, "I'm going to fire all the generals."
635	KAINE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	He doesn't have a plan.
636	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But he does have dangerous ideas.
637	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Here's four.
638	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He trash talks the military.
639	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.
640	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He wants to tear up alliances.
641	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay "big league."
642	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Third, he loves dictators.
643	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...
644	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, please.
645	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Come on.
646	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and Saddam Hussein.
647	KAINE	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.
648	KAINE	3	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them.
649	KAINE	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: "Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."
650	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.
651	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
652	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did you work on that one a long time?
653	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.
654	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it.
655	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States.
656	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's absolutely inarguable.
657	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	We've weakened America's place in the world.
658	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership.
659	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11.
660	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.
661	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...
662	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
663	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know you were.
664	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We all lived through that day as a nation.
665	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was heartbreaking.
666	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.
667	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida.
668	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our primary threat today is ISIS.
669	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
670	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl.
671	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Scott Zubowski.
672	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He fell in Fallujah in 2005.
673	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation.
674	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that nation was secured in 2009.
675	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war.
676	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The president just ordered more troops on the ground.
677	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are back at war in Iraq.
678	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.
679	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.
680	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?
681	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.
682	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, we did.
683	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You essentially...
684	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Even the Israeli military says it stopped.
685	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.
686	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism.
687	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey.
688	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents.
689	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?
690	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.
691	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.
692	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.
693	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...
694	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
695	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, I want to...
696	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
697	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, the question was about homegrown.
698	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program...
699	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.
700	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not -- that's absolutely false.
701	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine.
702	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Seventh Circuit...
703	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration.
704	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous?
705	KAINE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	These guys say all Mexicans are bad.
706	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's absolutely false.
707	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous.
708	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim.
709	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Mike Pence...
710	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely...
711	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	... put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria.
712	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...
713	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
714	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
715	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and said it was discriminatory...
716	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And those judges -- those judges said...
717	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.
718	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor?
719	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States.
720	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.
721	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
722	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
723	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game.
724	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.
725	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, Governor Pence...
726	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you bet I suspended that program.
727	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, Governor Pence, I just...
728	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I stand by that decision.
729	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
730	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sure.
731	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not.
732	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.
733	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the problem with that...
734	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...
735	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
736	PENCE	3	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.
737	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in.
738	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So -- the FBI...
739	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.
740	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain.
741	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator.
742	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I understand the...
743	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?
744	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...
745	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, let me ask you this.
746	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton...
747	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
748	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... has talked about an intelligence surge.
749	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
750	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What exactly would an intelligence surge look like?
751	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?
752	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine.
753	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's two things.
754	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.
755	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.
756	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the second piece of this is really, really important.
757	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies.
758	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next.
759	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Alliances are critical.
760	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.
761	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	That's not his plan.
762	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	Well, he said NATO is obsolete.
763	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?
764	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances.
765	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
766	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what an intelligence surge means.
767	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.
768	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
769	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria.
770	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Two hundred fifty thousand...
771	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
772	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.
773	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week.
774	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country.
775	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.
776	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
777	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have an intelligence, sir (ph).
778	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...
779	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up.
780	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.
781	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
782	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...
783	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
784	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor.
785	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server.
786	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
787	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step.
788	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this.
789	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	We have a justice system that does that.
790	KAINE	3	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that...
791	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, we are moving on now.
792	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Two hundred fifty thousand people...
793	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...
794	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor...
795	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... they'd be court martialed.
796	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is absolutely false and you know that.
797	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely true.
798	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know that, Governor.
799	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor...
800	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's absolutely true.
801	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen, please.
802	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Because the FBI did an investigation.
803	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen.
804	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further.
805	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sorry.
806	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.
807	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Syria.
808	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to turn now to Syria.
809	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria.
810	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries.
811	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?
812	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo.
813	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset.
814	PENCE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.
815	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.
816	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It begins by rebuilding our military.
817	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military.
818	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the smallest Navy since 1916.
819	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War.
820	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.
821	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.
822	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.
823	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.
824	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.
825	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.
826	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, your two minutes are up.
827	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've just got to have American strength on the world stage.
828	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president.
829	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
830	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea.
831	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not.
832	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin.
833	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.
834	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces.
835	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.
836	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.
837	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists.
838	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.
839	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll tell you what offends me...
840	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that offended me.
841	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military.
842	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, he won't.
843	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes.
844	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995.
845	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those years included the years of 9/11.
846	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So get this.
847	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States.
848	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism.
849	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight.
850	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.
851	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question was about Aleppo, Senator.
852	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He wouldn't support troops.
853	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine.
854	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.
855	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
856	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria.
857	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's very important.
858	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone.
859	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically?
860	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How would you keep it safe?
861	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops.

863	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He won't pay taxes.
864	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?
865	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How does that work?
866	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen, this is about Syria.
867	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to...
868	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
869	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Honestly, Senator.
870	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Honestly, Senator.
871	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is about our troops.
872	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is about our troops.
873	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.
874	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?
875	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I understand why you want to change the subject.
876	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let me be very clear on this Russian thing.
877	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The larger question here...
878	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?
879	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.
880	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates.
881	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.
882	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore.
883	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To answer your question, we just need American strength.
884	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way.
885	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And exactly how would those safe zones work?
886	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How would they remain safe?
887	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community.
888	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.
889	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, look, this is very tough stuff.
890	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade.
891	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years.
892	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
893	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...
894	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me -- let me come back...
895	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... is deeply troubling to me.
896	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
897	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine.
898	KAINE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
899	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He doesn't want to acknowledge...
900	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We didn't.
901	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden.
902	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He doesn't want to acknowledge...
903	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just did.
904	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.
905	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous.
906	KAINE	2	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.
907	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.
908	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.
909	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.
910	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And come on.
911	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator.
912	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton.
913	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that -- that's pretty low.
914	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?
915	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, the...
916	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what Donald Trump thinks.
917	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.
918	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...
919	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
920	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and assurance to our allies.
921	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let me go back to this Iran thing.
922	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
923	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
924	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.
925	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks.
926	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.
927	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You wouldn't necessarily know that.
928	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go to the tape.
929	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.
930	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I visited him in his office.
931	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I visited him in his office.
932	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You boycotted the speech.
933	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.
934	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then Hillary used them to get a deal.
935	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.
936	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, let me just mention one thing.
937	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
938	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence.
939	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions.
940	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons.
941	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That...
942	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
943	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And very quickly, Senator.
944	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine...
945	PENCE	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	... and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...
946	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to talk about Russia.
947	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very quickly, though, Senator, please.
948	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... is astonishing to the American people.
949	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next.
950	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.
951	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth.
952	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
953	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's going...
954	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
955	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.
956	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I just think that should be underlined.
957	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I'm -- look...
958	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
959	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia.
960	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a topic that has come up.
961	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump.
962	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.
963	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will give you an opportunity to do that.
964	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	More nations should get nuclear weapons.
965	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Try to defend that.
966	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Don't put words in my mouth.
967	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Well, he never said that, Senator.
968	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He absolutely said it.
969	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.
970	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.
971	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Gentlemen, Russia.
972	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime.
973	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?
974	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
975	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've got to be tough on Russia.
976	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
977	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.
978	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Donald Trump has business...
979	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, we haven't.
980	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.
981	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.
982	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.
983	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's had the experience doing it.
984	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.
985	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.
986	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.
987	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh, that's nonsense.
988	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, "I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."
989	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.
990	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	He knew that.
991	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.
992	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.
993	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.
994	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.
995	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time.
996	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason.
997	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?
998	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do.
999	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...
1000	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what's it got to do with Russia?
1001	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia.
1002	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...
1003	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, he hasn't said that.
1004	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has, actually.
1005	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, your time is up.
1006	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor?
1007	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, thanks.
1008	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.
1009	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.
1010	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah.
1011	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I know you can't defend.
1012	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, please.
1013	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the governor's two minutes.
1014	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm happy to defend him, Senator.
1015	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.
1016	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're not.
1017	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm happy to defend him.
1018	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.
1019	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...
1020	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.
1021	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, please.
1022	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is Governor Pence's two minutes.
1023	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality.
1024	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.
1025	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula.
1026	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump knew that happened.
1027	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.
1028	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.
1029	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding.
1030	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.
1031	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.
1032	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure.
1033	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...
1034	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.
1035	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... on the day that Iran released four American hostages...
1036	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
1037	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor...
1038	PENCE	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	... we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.
1039	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1040	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...
1041	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.
1042	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... quote, "Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."
1043	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?
1044	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Strength.
1045	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Plain and simple.
1046	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Business dealings.
1047	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.
1048	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump is a strong leader...
1049	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...
1050	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... who is going to lead with American strength.
1051	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.
1052	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to rebuild our military.
1053	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.
1054	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, America is stronger than Russia.
1055	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.
1056	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.
1057	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.
1058	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.
1059	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...
1060	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
1061	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
1062	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.
1063	KAINE	4	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.
1064	PENCE	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	That is absolutely inaccurate.
1065	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...
1066	PENCE	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.
1067	KAINE	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	No, he said leader.
1068	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor.
1069	PENCE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You just said better.
1070	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...
1071	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, here we go.
1072	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the grade school thing again?
1073	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... persecuting journalists...
1074	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right, this is grade school.
1075	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.
1076	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah.
1077	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.
1078	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.
1079	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.
1080	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?
1081	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Vladimir Putin.
1082	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
1083	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what would do you differently?
1084	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
1085	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's not a leader.
1086	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.
1087	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.
1088	KAINE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB.
1089	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.
1090	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
1091	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So how do deal with him?
1092	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.
1093	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are areas where we can cooperate.
1094	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.
1095	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.
1096	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.
1097	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.
1098	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
1099	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons.
1100	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.
1101	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
1102	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?
1103	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
1104	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.
1105	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.
1106	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.
1107	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.
1108	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.
1109	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up.
1110	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It must have -- must have...
1111	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Until he...
1112	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1113	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... done well in some focus group.
1114	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.
1115	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.
1116	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.
1117	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.
1118	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They cannot make financial contributions.
1119	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.
1120	PENCE	3	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.
1121	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...
1122	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, your two minutes are up.
1123	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...
1124	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, please.
1125	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... while she's secretary of state.
1126	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your two minutes are up, Governor.
1127	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And they're saying enough is enough.
1128	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
1129	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea.
1130	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, on the foundation.
1131	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am glad to talk about the foundation.
1132	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.
1133	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.
1134	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.
1135	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.
1136	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.
1137	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.
1138	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.
1139	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the foundation does good work.
1140	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.
1141	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.
1142	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.
1143	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He's refused to do it.
1144	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.
1145	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.
1146	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.
1147	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Trump Foundation is non-profit.
1148	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.
1149	KAINE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.
1150	KAINE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.
1151	KAINE	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.
1152	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.
1153	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.
1154	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
1155	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, Thank you.
1156	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1157	PENCE	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.
1158	PENCE	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.
1159	KAINE	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Political contributions?
1160	PENCE	6	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
1161	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?
1162	PENCE	6	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
1163	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Ninety percent.
1164	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.
1165	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...
1166	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, let's turn back to North Korea...
1167	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... that she refused to turn over in her private server...
1168	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine...
1169	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.
1170	QUIJANO	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?
1171	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.
1172	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to.
1173	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A president has to do that.
1174	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.
1175	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.
1176	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.
1177	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.
1178	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.
1179	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.
1180	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.
1181	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.
1182	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we're working together with China, and we need to.
1183	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.
1184	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary understands that very well.
1185	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, "Women's rights are human rights."
1186	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	They didn't want her to say that, but she did.
1187	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.
1188	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what it's going to take.
1189	KAINE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.
1190	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.
1191	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
1192	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'd like to turn to our next segment now.
1193	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.
1194	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.
1195	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?
1196	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine?
1197	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.
1198	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's an easy one.
1199	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm really fortunate.
1200	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.
1201	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My mom and dad are sitting right here.
1202	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.
1203	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My 40th reunion is in 10 days.
1204	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.
1205	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.
1206	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.
1207	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.
1208	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.
1209	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I had to grapple with that.
1210	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.
1211	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.
1212	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.
1213	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.
1214	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was elected, and I did.
1215	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.
1216	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was a real struggle.
1217	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.
1218	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence?
1219	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, it's a wonderful question.
1220	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.
1221	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.
1222	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.
1223	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.
1224	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.
1225	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.
1226	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.
1227	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I truly do.
1228	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's shared.
1229	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.
1230	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.
1231	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.
1232	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.
1233	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.
1234	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.
1235	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.
1236	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.
1237	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.
1238	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So for me, my faith informs my life.
1239	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.
1240	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.
1241	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.
1242	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.
1243	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.
1244	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.
1245	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let's talk about abortion and choice.
1246	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's talk about them.
1247	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We support Roe v. Wade.
1248	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.
1249	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's something we trust American women to do that.
1250	KAINE	2	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.
1251	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.
1252	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.
1253	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.
1254	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is pretty important.
1255	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.
1256	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you should live your moral values.
1257	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.
1258	KAINE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.
1259	PENCE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, it's really not.
1260	PENCE	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.
1261	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then why did Donald Trump say that?
1262	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We just never would.
1263	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why did he say that?
1264	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.
1265	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so...
1266	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I would admit that's not a polished...
1267	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
1268	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.
1269	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, can I say...
1270	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.
1271	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.
1272	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.
1273	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah.
1274	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...
1275	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm telling you...
1276	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.
1277	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again.
1278	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He -- look...
1279	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can you defend it?
1280	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.
1281	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?
1282	PENCE	3	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	He also said and many of them are good people.
1283	PENCE	2	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	You keep leaving that out of your quote.
1284	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.
1285	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life.
1286	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.
1287	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.
1288	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.
1289	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.
1290	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can create a culture of life.
1291	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.
1292	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...
1293	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is important --
1294	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.
1295	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are so many families around the country who can't have children.
1296	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We could improve adoption...
1297	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, Governor...
1298	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.
1299	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?
1300	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can encourage people to support life.
1301	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course we can.
1302	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But why don't you trust women?
1303	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?
1304	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what we ought to be doing in public life.
1305	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...
1306	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because there are...
1307	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.
1308	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.
1309	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe it with all my heart.
1310	PENCE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.
1311	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do have one final question for you both tonight.
1312	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has been a divisive campaign.
1313	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?
1314	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's a really important one.
1315	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.
1316	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.
1317	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we do have to bring the country together.
1318	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So here's what we'll do.
1319	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.
1320	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I served in the Senate.
1321	KAINE	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.
1322	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was on the Armed Services Committee.
1323	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was on other committees.
1324	KAINE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.
1325	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.
1326	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.
1327	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.
1328	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.
1329	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.
1330	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.
1331	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.
1332	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.
1333	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?
1334	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...
1335	KAINE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely.
1336	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... tonight.
1337	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
1338	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.
1339	PENCE	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.
1340	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.
1341	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.
1342	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill.
1343	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.
1344	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.
1345	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.
1346	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They want to see an American comeback.
1347	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.
1348	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.
1349	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.
1350	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.
1351	PENCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.
1352	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.
1353	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This concludes the vice presidential debate.
1354	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching.
1355	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
1356	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News.
1357	QUIJANO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Good night.
