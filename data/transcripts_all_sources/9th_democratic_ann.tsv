0	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules.
1	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As moderator, I'll guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups.
2	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You'll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis.
3	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You'll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups.
4	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Timing lights will signal when your time is up.
5	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Both candidates have agreed to these rules now.
6	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Opening statements, you'll each have two minutes.
7	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's begin with Senator Sanders.
8	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
9	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wolf, thank you very much.
10	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	CNN, thank you very much.
11	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.
12	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls.
13	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton.
14	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.
15	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
16	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.
17	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
18	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging -- guess what -- $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.
19	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.
20	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...
21	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
22	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.
23	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
24	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.
25	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
26	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
27	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...
28	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
29	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.
30	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...
31	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
32	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.
33	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together.
34	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We faced 9/11.
35	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We worked hard to rebuild New York.
36	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.
37	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.
38	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.
39	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
40	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that is -- that is exactly what I want to do as your president.
41	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will celebrate our diversity.
42	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America.
43	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential.
44	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is what my campaign is about.
45	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
46	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
47	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised.
48	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.
49	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president.
50	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.
51	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?
52	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?
53	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We worked together in the Senate.
54	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign.
55	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Washington Post headline says ""Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified"" and that's what the surrogates were saying."
56	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?
57	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course she does.
58	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
59	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I do question...
60	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
61	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- but I do question her judgment.
62	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...
63	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
64	SANDERS	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	-- the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.
65	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.
66	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't believe that that is...
67	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
68	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.
69	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
70	HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.
71	HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've been called a lot of things in my life.
72	HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	That was a first.
73	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
74	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And then he did say that...
75	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
76	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- he had to question my judgment.
77	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...
78	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
79	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- and...
80	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
81	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.
82	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
83	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, look, we have disagreements on policy.
84	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's no doubt about it.
85	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks."
86	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When asked, he could not explain how...
87	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
88	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- that would be done and...
89	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
90	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- when asked...
91	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
92	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.
93	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.
94	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator...
95	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
96	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let's talk about judgment.
97	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes!
98	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
99	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...
100	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
101	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I led the opposition to that war.
102	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton voted for that.
103	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let's talk about judgment.
104	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.
105	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Where does the money come from?
106	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?
107	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think so.
108	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
109	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me...
110	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have...
111	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- let me just say...
112	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- (INAUDIBLE)...
113	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- let me -- let me say...
114	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Madam Secretary, let him finish.
115	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
116	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small.
117	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
118	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
119	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people.
120	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I...
121	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
122	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- my (INAUDIBLE).
123	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
124	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary?
125	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, make -- make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama.
126	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama...
127	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(BOOS)
128	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, let me tell you why.
129	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why.
130	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.
131	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.
132	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...
133	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
134	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- on Wall Street in many a year.
135	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.
136	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank, Secretary.
137	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.
138	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis.
139	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.
140	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?
141	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?
142	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Absolutely.
143	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.
144	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.
145	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.
146	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.
147	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.
148	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are two sections there.
149	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.
150	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's look at what is at stake here.
151	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.
152	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.
153	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.
154	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to execute under it.
155	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, you're right.
156	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.
157	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...
158	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Thank you, Secretary.
159	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.
160	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"You said, quote, ""That's their decision."""
161	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?
162	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First, Dana...
163	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?
164	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's right.
165	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, let's start off with the basic premise.
166	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.
167	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.
168	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.
169	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.
170	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, Senator...
171	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.
172	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?
173	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.
174	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've got to be a certain size.
175	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.
176	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.
177	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What we need is to make sure that they are safe.
178	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
179	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn.
180	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
181	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.
182	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.
183	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That has to be the judgement of the regulators.
184	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, there's another element to this.
185	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.
186	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
187	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.
188	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
189	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And hold them accountable as well.
190	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
191	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street.
192	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?
193	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sure.
194	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sure.
195	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.
196	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that.
197	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.
198	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
199	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.
200	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what my legislation does.
201	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.
202	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
203	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is important -- it's always important.
204	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.
205	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.
206	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I called them out on their mortgage behavior.
207	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.
208	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.
209	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is the law.
210	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, this is our ninth debate.
211	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.
212	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't just say, we're upset about this.
213	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm upset about it.
214	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't just say, go break them up.
215	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.
216	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
217	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.
218	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to include the shadow banking sector.
219	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
220	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders.
221	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
222	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton called them out.
223	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.
224	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?
225	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.
226	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference.
227	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These banks, in my view, have too much power.
228	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.
229	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If elected president, I will break them up.
230	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.
231	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
232	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs.
233	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?
234	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
235	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue.
236	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.
237	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.
238	CLINTON	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.
239	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.
240	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a giant insurance company, AIG.
241	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.
242	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.
243	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...
244	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Madam Secretary...
245	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... but the fact is he did.
246	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...
247	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
248	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
249	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, one second, please.
250	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.
251	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
252	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why not release them?
253	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president.
254	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a new one.
255	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side.
256	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know that.
257	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.
258	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I've released 30 years of tax returns.
259	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.
260	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
261	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination.
262	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Right.
263	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.
264	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not about the Republicans...
265	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
266	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
267	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.
268	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.
269	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everybody does it, and then we move forward.
270	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
271	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me respond.
272	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it.
273	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will do it.
274	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
275	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents.
276	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There were no speeches.
277	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
278	SANDERS	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And second of all, of course we will release our taxes.
279	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Jane does our taxes.
280	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've been a little bit busy lately.
281	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You'll excuse us.
282	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we will...
283	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator...
284	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will get them out.
285	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator...
286	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
287	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, when are you -- when are you -- you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.
288	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow.
289	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Which one?
290	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Last year's.
291	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2014?
292	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
293	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What about 2013, all the other ones?
294	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You'll get them, yes.
295	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited.
296	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are very boring tax returns.
297	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No big money from speeches, no major investments.
298	SANDERS	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.
299	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's what that will show.
300	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
301	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?
302	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
303	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what about the earlier ones?
304	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What's the problem... SANDERS: Yes.
305	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What's taking so long?
306	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.
307	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
308	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them.
309	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And she's been out on the campaign trail.
310	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We will get them out.
311	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll get them out very shortly.
312	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not a big deal.
313	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
314	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States.
315	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses.
316	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"He says you are, quote, ""uninformed on this issue"" and disconnected from reality."
317	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?
318	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.
319	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
320	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this is -- this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country.
321	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary.
322	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's his -- that's his compensation.
323	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and -- and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs.
324	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.
325	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
326	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
327	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?
328	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all, the word contempt is not right.
329	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.
330	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
331	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Verizon happens not to be one of them.
332	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
333	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine.
334	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...
335	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
336	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.
337	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(BOOS)
338	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.
339	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?
340	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
341	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
342	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.
343	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
344	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those.
345	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That has got to change.
346	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
347	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary...
348	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
349	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- Secretary Clinton?
350	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
351	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.
352	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.
353	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.
354	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.
355	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's exactly what I will do.
356	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.
357	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting -- more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.
358	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.
359	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...
360	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator...
361	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.
362	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
363	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's do that again in America.
364	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, how do you...
365	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to respond...
366	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'll have you respond in a moment.
367	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
368	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Stand by.
369	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look...
370	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)
371	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.
372	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.
373	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
374	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As president...
375	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
376	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?
377	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, of course I would.
378	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have supported...
379	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
380	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	-- I have supported the fight for 15.
381	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.
382	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage.
383	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I always have.
384	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I supported that when I was in the Senate.
385	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look...
386	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York.
387	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15.
388	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is exactly my position.
389	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.
390	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
391	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go as quickly as...
392	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
393	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- to get to $15.
394	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
395	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
396	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
397	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, wait a minute...
398	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(INAUDIBLE).
399	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- wait a minute.
400	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(INAUDIBLE).
401	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- wait, wait...
402	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's just not accurate.
403	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
404	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...
405	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- well and I...
406	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- with Senator Sanders eight...
407	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
408	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- times.
409	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me.
410	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have said the...
411	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
412	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Exact same thing.
413	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, Senator, please.
414	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we can...
415	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
416	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- raise it to $15 in New York...
417	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
418	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- or Los Angeles or Seattle...
419	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, the viewers...
420	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- let's do it.
421	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.
422	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
423	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So please...
424	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will...
425	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- don't talk over each other.
426	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe I was...
427	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
428	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead.
429	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- responding.
430	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right?
431	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.
432	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.
433	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's a difference.
434	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.
435	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK.
436	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
437	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead, Secretary.
438	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary?
439	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And suddenly...
440	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, go ahead.
441	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To suddenly...
442	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
443	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much.
444	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate.
445	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
446	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary?
447	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
448	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.
449	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true.
450	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I also -- I supported the $15 effort in L.A.
451	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I supported in Seattle.
452	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.
453	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right?
454	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that.
455	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.
456	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference.
457	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thirty-five million people will get a raise.
458	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One in four working mothers will get a raise.
459	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to get something done.
460	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15.
461	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.
462	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
463	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
464	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.
465	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.
466	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
467	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, in fact -- in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage.
468	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's good.
469	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.
470	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
471	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...
472	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
473	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.
474	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
475	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
476	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America.
477	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, ""the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York."""
478	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.
479	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?
480	CLINTON	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	No, of course not.
481	CLINTON	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Of course not.
482	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is -- this is a serious difference between us.
483	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(LAUGHTER)
484	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what I want to start by saying -- it's not a laughing matter -- 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year.
485	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.
486	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yes, we have a problem in America.
487	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.
488	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.
489	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
490	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what we have here is a big difference.
491	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.
492	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.
493	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield.
494	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He said they didn't deserve their day in court.
495	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I could not disagree more.
496	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.
497	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
498	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That has this kind of special protection.
499	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree.
500	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...
501	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Thank you...
502	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?
503	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
504	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator?
505	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.
506	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.
507	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.
508	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You made the point what she said was totally absurd.
509	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence.
510	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She said no.
511	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, go ahead.
512	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then why did she put out that statement?
513	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I put it out...
514	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.
515	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Please, go ahead sir.
516	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.
517	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Here is the fact on guns.
518	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's talk about guns.
519	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.
520	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont.
521	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?
522	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.
523	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.
524	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
525	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.
526	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
527	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
528	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
529	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CHEERING)
530	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?
531	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.
532	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.
533	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.
534	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.
535	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.
536	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.
537	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.
538	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.
539	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.
540	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
541	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.
542	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.
543	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.
544	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you?
545	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.
546	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.
547	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.
548	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.
549	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?
550	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, I don't think I owe them an apology.
551	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.
552	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.
553	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.
554	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.
555	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.
556	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.
557	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.
558	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.
559	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
560	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.
561	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
562	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
563	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.
564	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
565	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.
566	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.
567	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.
568	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?
569	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.
570	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you mentioned some of them.
571	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.
572	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
573	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.
574	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.
575	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.
576	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that sentences got much too long.
577	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.
578	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we have a problem.
579	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.
580	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.
581	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So that's how I see it.
582	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.
583	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
584	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.
585	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake."""
586	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, ""it's clearly insufficient."""
587	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?
588	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look, I supported the crime bill.
589	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My husband has apologized.
590	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...
591	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what about you, Senator?
592	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... voted for it.
593	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.
594	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.
595	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.
596	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I also want people...
597	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
598	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... especially I want -- I want white people -- I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism.
599	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.
600	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
601	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.
602	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why did you call him out?
603	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.
604	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
605	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right.
606	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We had a crime bill.
607	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I voted for it.
608	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.
609	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence.
610	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This took us a good step forward.
611	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.
612	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.
613	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.
614	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.
615	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.
616	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this.
617	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.
618	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know what I think?
619	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.
620	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
621	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll tell you what else.
622	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'll tell you what else I think.
623	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it.
624	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.
625	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.
626	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period.
627	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.
628	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
629	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
630	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
631	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.
632	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.
633	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.
634	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.
635	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.
636	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in...
637	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
638	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
639	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
640	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.
641	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.
642	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.
643	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.
644	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners.
645	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?
646	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to work with state governments all over this country.
647	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know what?
648	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.
649	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities.
650	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support.
651	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.
652	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
653	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
654	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to take a quick commercial break.
655	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.
656	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
657	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Welcome back.
658	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's turn to another critically important issue.
659	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.
660	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.
661	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.
662	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What are his lies?
663	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.
664	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.
665	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.
666	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.
667	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge."
668	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.
669	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.
670	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.
671	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.
672	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
673	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.
674	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.
675	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.
676	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.
677	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
678	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount.
679	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's true.
680	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.
681	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.
682	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
683	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, it is not good enough.
684	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it.
685	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That was what 9/11 was about.
686	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances.
687	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's going to be international conflict.
688	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...
689	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	....
690	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you...
691	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Including a tax on carbon.
692	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.
693	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
694	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.
695	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.
696	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.
697	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
698	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.
699	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
700	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough.
701	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...
702	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Thank you...
703	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE CHEERING)
704	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...
705	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Go ahead, Senator...
706	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Let's talk about that.
707	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.
708	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CHEERING)
709	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there.
710	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've got to get beyond paper right now.
711	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.
712	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.
713	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land.
714	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not Secretary Clinton's position.
715	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
716	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let us support a tax on carbon...
717	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Secretary Clinton...
718	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Not Secretary Clinton's position.
719	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Go ahead and respond.
720	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
721	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.
722	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.
723	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
724	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.
725	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
726	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.
727	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's harder to do something about the problem.
728	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And...
729	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
730	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
731	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We'll continue on this.
732	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.
733	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wolf.
734	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wolf.
735	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to continue on this.
736	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Errol, go ahead.
737	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described.
738	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.
739	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.
740	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why have you changed your view on fracking?
741	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.
742	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.
743	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.
744	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.
745	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's why I've set big goals.
746	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.
747	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
748	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.
749	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
750	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, Senator?
751	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, here is -- here is a real difference.
752	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.
753	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
754	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not right now.
755	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not on climate change.
756	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.
757	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
758	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
759	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.
760	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?
761	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
762	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.
763	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.
764	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.
765	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's exactly what I have proposed.
766	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.
767	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.
768	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
769	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.
770	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.
771	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...
772	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you for a tax on carbon or not?
773	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a question for you.
774	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.
775	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.
776	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.
777	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?
778	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, they wouldn't.
779	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, here's where we are.
780	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let me reiterate.
781	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a global crisis.
782	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.
783	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation.
784	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is absolutely true.
785	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There will be some people who lose their job.
786	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.
787	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is not their fault...
788	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.
789	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly.
790	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What does that mean?
791	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator -- senator, jobs...
792	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes?
793	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...
794	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you don't phase...
795	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- that difference?
796	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- it all out tomorrow.
797	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.
798	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But this is what you do do.
799	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
800	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.
801	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.
802	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CHEERING)
803	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Saving -- rebuilding our rail system.

806	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
807	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.
808	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.
809	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
810	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
811	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lead the world.
812	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
813	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
814	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let's turn to another critically important issue...
815	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
816	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.
817	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.
818	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were his secretary of State.
819	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Aren't you also responsible for that?
820	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.
821	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And here's what we did.
822	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.
823	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was very proud of that.
824	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.
825	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We also worked to help them set up their government.
826	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We sent a lot of American experts there.
827	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.
828	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.
829	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so we were caught in a very difficult position.
830	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.
831	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.
832	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we can't walk away from that.
833	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We need to be working with European and Arab partners...
834	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
835	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.
836	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.
837	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them
838	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
839	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"According to ""The New York Times."
840	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	".. 841 SYSTEM (APPLAUSE) 842 SANDERS -- for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator? 843 SANDERS The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change."
844	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.
845	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
846	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look...
847	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
848	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs.
849	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No debate about that.
850	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.
851	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold.
852	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think if you studied the whole history of...
853	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes.
854	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.
855	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, we're going to let you respond.
856	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
857	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, well, I...
858	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
859	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- I...
860	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
861	CLINTON	2	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.
862	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.
863	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No.
864	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
865	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did.
866	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We went to the United Nations Security Council.
867	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We got support from the Security Council.
868	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.
869	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.
870	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.
871	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.
872	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
873	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CROSSTALK)
874	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
875	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.
876	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?
877	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy.
878	SANDERS	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.
879	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Totally different issue.
880	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, that isn't...
881	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...
882	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.
883	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead, Secretary.
884	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.
885	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yes, it was unanimous.
886	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's exactly right, including you.
887	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.
888	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The decision was the president's.
889	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did I do the due diligence?
890	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?
891	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?
892	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, I did.
893	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's what a secretary of state does.
894	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.
895	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the president made that decision.
896	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.
897	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
898	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead, Senator.
899	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you listen, you know -- two points.
900	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.
901	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.
902	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.
903	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.
904	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.
905	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.
906	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The president said no.
907	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, that's how it works.
908	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.
909	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.
910	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.
911	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.
912	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote:  ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."""
913	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you still feel that way?
914	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.
915	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.
916	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, I do.
917	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
918	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.
919	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?
920	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.
921	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.
922	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.
923	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.
924	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nothing wrong with that.
925	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
926	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton?
927	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I support our continuing involvement in NATO.
928	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.
929	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.
930	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there's a larger question here.
931	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.
932	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.
933	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So...
934	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON:  ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.
935	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.
936	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?
937	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will stay in NATO.
938	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.
939	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.
940	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.
941	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.
942	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That meant a lot.
943	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.
944	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.
945	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.
946	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
947	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
948	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel.
949	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	"Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life."""
950	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
951	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?
952	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.
953	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not a debate.
954	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
955	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that.
956	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism.
957	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.
958	AUDIENCE MEMBER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Free Palestine!
959	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.
960	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
961	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, let me say something else.
962	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.
963	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
964	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%.
965	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated.
966	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.
967	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That does not make me anti-Israel.
968	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That paves the way, I think...
969	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Thank you, Senator...
970	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	...to an approach that works in the Middle East.
971	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
972	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
973	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?
974	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.
975	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did it in concert with...
976	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
977	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.
978	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.
979	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.
980	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
981	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.
982	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.
983	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.
984	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have a right to defend yourself.
985	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
986	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.
987	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.
988	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...
989	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Thank you...
990	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... just let me finish.
991	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.
992	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.
993	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
994	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator.
995	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.
996	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is not the issue.
997	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, you evaded the answer.
998	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You evaded the question.
999	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism.
1000	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's not the debate.
1001	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Was their response disproportionate?
1002	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe that it was, you have not answered that.
1003	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CHEERING)
1004	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will certainly be willing to answer it.
1005	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.
1006	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(AUDIENCE REACTION)
1007	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.
1008	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza.
1009	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They took out all the Israelis.
1010	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.
1011	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And what happened?
1012	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hamas took over Gaza.
1013	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.
1014	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
1015	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator.
1016	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.
1017	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.
1018	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Almost none in that speech.
1019	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1020	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So here is the issue:  of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.
1021	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.
1022	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.
1023	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.
1024	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.
1025	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Three long meetings.
1026	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.
1027	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.
1028	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security.
1029	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1030	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A final word, Senator, go ahead.
1031	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.
1032	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1033	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
1034	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary.
1035	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.
1036	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.
1037	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.
1038	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
1039	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.
1040	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.
1041	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.
1042	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are two sides to the issue.
1043	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
1044	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
1045	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have to take another quick, quick break.
1046	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York.
1047	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is coming up right after this.
1048	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1049	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.
1050	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're here in Brooklyn.
1051	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.
1052	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges.
1053	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt.
1054	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How is this fiscally responsible?
1055	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, first of all, I disagree with that study.
1056	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.
1057	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French.
1058	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...
1059	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1060	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.
1061	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Public colleges and universities tuition free?
1062	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Damn right.
1063	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is exactly what we should be doing.
1064	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1065	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.
1066	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.
1067	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.

1069	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
1070	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, go ahead and respond.
1071	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.
1072	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare.
1073	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.
1074	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.
1075	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families.
1076	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There's no doubt about that.
1077	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...
1078	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1079	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... are actually going to work.
1080	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.
1081	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He changed in the middle of this campaign.
1082	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He put out another plan.
1083	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People have been analyzing the new plan.
1084	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.
1085	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor.
1086	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.
1087	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The same for free college.
1088	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.
1089	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You read the fine print, and here's what it says.
1090	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
1091	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The fine print says this, that it will -- the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...
1092	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
1093	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you.
1094	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.
1095	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.
1096	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary please.
1097	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.
1098	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1099	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.
1100	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know?
1101	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country.
1102	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're doing OK.
1103	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people.
1104	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can do the same.
1105	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing.
1106	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime?
1107	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For trying to get an education.
1108	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
1109	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yes, we are going to pay for it...
1110	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well...
1111	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, go ahead.
1112	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have -- we have a difference of opinion.
1113	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We both want to get to universal health care coverage.
1114	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.
1115	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1116	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.
1117	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...
1118	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
1119	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.
1120	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue.
1121	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits.
1122	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500?
1123	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes or no, would you lift the cap?
1124	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
1125	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is one way.
1126	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.
1127	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But there are other ways.
1128	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.
1129	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.
1130	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But here's the real issue, because I -- I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.
1131	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.
1132	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.
1133	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.
1134	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.
1135	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...
1136	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Secretary.
1137	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- system and that will be my highest priority.
1138	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator?
1139	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead, Senator.
1140	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1141	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.
1142	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did.
1143	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If that's the way we're...
1144	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No, you didn't.
1145	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My legi...
1146	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- yes, I did.
1147	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Can I answer...
1148	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did answer the...
1149	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- may I please...
1150	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, don't -- don't put words...
1151	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- can I have... (CROSSTALK)
1152	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- into my mouth and say something...
1153	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- do I not?
1154	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- that's not accurate.
1155	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Go ahead, Senator.
1156	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right.
1157	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)...
1158	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1159	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, we've got -- here is the issue.
1160	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your answer has been the same year after year.
1161	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea.
1162	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea.
1163	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1164	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up.
1165	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
1166	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.
1167	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What's wrong with that?
1168	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you prepared to support it?
1169	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have supported it.
1170	CLINTON	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.
1171	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have sup...
1172	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's important...
1173	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1174	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- to point out that...
1175	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1176	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- you know, we're -- we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
1177	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Think about what the other side wants to do.
1178	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.
1179	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	They still want to privatize it.
1180	CLINTON	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.
1181	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All right, so...
1182	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, yes, we both want to make sure...
1183	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1184	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, Wolf...

1186	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- I am very glad that...

1211	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I didn't say anything different tonight.
1212	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
1213	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There is still something called Congress.
1214	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate...
1215	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Errol...
1216	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- so a lot of -- a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented...
1217	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Errol, hold on a second.

1227	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- maybe I'm a little bit confused.
1228	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...

1265	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-- a question for you.
1266	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just a second, Senator.
1267	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court.
1268	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election.
1269	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?
1270	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this.
1271	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals.
1272	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I fully support the president.
1273	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1274	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I believe that the president -- the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history.
1275	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond.
1276	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'm going to support the president.
1277	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.
1278	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders.
1279	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, there is no question.
1280	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, it really is an outrage.
1281	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.
1282	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court.
1283	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.
1284	LOUIS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?
1285	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate.
1286	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think -- I think this.
1287	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.
1288	(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.
1289	(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.
1290	(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth.
1291	(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.
1292	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1293	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights.
1294	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.
1295	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we are never asked about this.
1296	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction.
1297	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I don't think it's a distraction.
1298	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.
1299	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, your response.
1300	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so.
1301	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1302	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
1303	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who not only thinks we are not going to -- not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.
1304	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1305	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders, you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress.
1306	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat.
1307	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now you're seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat.
1308	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are you?
1309	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States?
1310	(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But here is a good point.
1311	(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.
1312	(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points.
1313	(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you know why?
1314	(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because in fact a whole lot of people -- this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.
1315	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1316	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders...
1317	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes.
1318	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.
1319	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator Sanders.
1320	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1321	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am in this race as a Democrat.
1322	SANDERS	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected.
1323	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign.
1324	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CHEERING)
1325	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times.
1326	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year.
1327	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You don't appear to have raised any money for the party.
1328	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you.
1329	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?
1330	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC.
1331	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.
1332	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.
1333	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1334	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors.
1335	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...
1336	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Thank you Senator.
1337	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	$27 a contribution...
1338	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Senator, your time is up...
1339	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see.

1343	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Let us talk about where we are in this race.
1344	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I've gotten more votes than anybody running.
1345	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	9.6 million at the last count.

1347	CLINTON	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.
1348	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1349	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.

1351	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think you have to look at the facts.
1352	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running.
1353	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating.
1354	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
1355	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Madam Secretary.

1358	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, I want to say -- I also want to say that I do -- I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.
1359	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.
1360	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.
1361	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...
1362	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Secretary Clinton, thank you.
1363	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And, I know something about that...
1364	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Secretary Clinton...
1365	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you so much.
1366	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama...
1367	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	...Secretary Clinton, you're out of time...
1368	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president...
1369	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	...Senator Sanders, on that note....
1370	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Let me, if I may just briefly say something...
1371	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response.
1372	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Three months now between now and the Democratic convention.
1373	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone.
1374	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1375	BASH	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?
1376	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth.
1377	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(CHEERING)
1378	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true.
1379	SANDERS	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South.
1380	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No question about it.
1381	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We got murdered there.
1382	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That is the most conservative part of this great country.
1383	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That's the fact.
1384	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But you know what?
1385	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're out of the Deep South now.
1386	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we're moving up.
1387	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We got here.
1388	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We're going to California.
1389	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We got a number of large states there.
1390	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.
1391	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1392	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now, let me say this...
1393	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secretary Clinton, go ahead.
1394	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it's -- I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.
1395	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.
1396	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.
1397	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1398	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.
1399	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.
1400	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.
1401	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.
1402	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...
1403	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Senator, go ahead.
1404	CLINTON	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... that we'll go onto the general election with.
1405	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The reason -- the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people -- and I'm not just talking about very young.
1406	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You know, the older you get, the younger young gets -- 45 or younger -- is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face.
1407	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1408	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests.
1409	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...
1410	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator.
1411	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... many of whom previously had given up.
1412	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you, Senator, very much.
1413	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this.
1414	BLITZER	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.

1419	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
1420	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.
1421	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life.
1422	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country.
1423	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I just don't accept that.
1424	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.
1425	SANDERS	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.
1426	SYSTEM	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	(APPLAUSE)
