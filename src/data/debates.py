# 1. reads debate files and returns all the sentences in an array                        #
# ( a sentence is an object from the class sentence )                                    #
# 2. reads claimBuster scores (the process of getting CB scores is in file "cb_scrape.py #
# 3. split the data (sentences) into training and testing sets for corss-validation      #
